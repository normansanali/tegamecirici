In 2023, he will have a net worth of $5 million. His spectacular on-field achievements catapulted him into the spotlight, earning him several honors and a passionate fan base.</strong></p><p>Naturally, there is a lot of interest in his NFL contract, the statistics behind his pay, and the numerous avenues that add to his massive financial portfolio. Mecole Hardman, born in Bowman, Georgia, in 1998, is an American football wide receiver for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League.</p><p>He began his NFL career in 2019 after being selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the second round, 56th overall. He established himself as a solid wide receiver and return specialist during his tenure with the Chiefs. He had a memorable debut season, scoring his first NFL touchdown, which helped the Chiefs win Super Bowl LIV. In addition, in 2022, he became the first wide receiver in Super Bowl history to score both a running and a receiving touchdown in the same game.</p><h2>Mecole Hardman Net Worth: Discover His Contacts, Salary, And Income</h2><p>Because of his exceptional speed and ability, the 25-year-old NFL wide receiver has made a name for himself on the field. As of 2023, Mecole Hardman’s net worth is $5 million. Hardman signed a one-year, $4,000,000 contract with the New York Jets in March of 2023, with a $2,500,000 signing bonus, according to the most latest statistics.</p><p>He did, however, see minimal action this season, with only one reception. In October 2023, Hardman was traded to the Chiefs in exchange for a sixth-round pick in 2025. He has earned a total of $12,054,959 in his five seasons since 2019. It consists of a $7,082,144 salary, a $4,152,764 signing bonus, a $150,000 workout bonus, and incentives totaling $250,066. In addition to his NFL contract, Hardman gets money from sponsorships.</p><h2>Hardman Was Acquired by the Chiefs in a Trade with the New York Jets</h2><p>After signing a one-year, $4 million contract with the Jets in 2023, Hardman played little in the offense. He only had 28 offensive plays and one catch in five games. He expressed his frustration with his employment and lack of connection with the Jets in an ESPN interview.</p><p>He made a statement, saying,</p><p><strong>“I’M PROBABLY THE BEST IN THE LEAGUE IN SPACE,” that’s what he claimed. “MAYBE [THE COACHES] SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT.”</strong></p><p>He investigated the reasons behind his underuse in scripts and gadget-style running plays at the time. Mecole Hardman Jr. was acquired by the Kansas City Chiefs in a trade with the New York Jets in October 2023. In exchange for Hardman and a 2025 seventh-round pick, the Chiefs handed the Jets a 2025 sixth-round pick. Mecole was overjoyed to learn that the Chiefs were among the teams interested in the transaction.</p><p>He stated during the interview,</p><p><strong>“When I heard it was Kansas City, I was excited to get back here.”</strong></p><p>This season, the Chiefs’ wide receiver performance has been a source of concern. Rashee Rice, a second-round draft pick, leads the team in catches, receptions, and yards at his position. Expectations for veteran wideouts Marquez Valdes-Scantling, Kadarius Toney, and Skyy Moore have also fallen short for the Chiefs.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/"}{"1":54}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Football League player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Ian Thorpe Children | Does He Have Any | Wife And Husband Details</a></h3>Retired Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe is well-known for his remarkable abilities in the individual medley, backstroke, and freestyle swimming.
