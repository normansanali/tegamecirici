For instance, the likes of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vision Quest</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nova</a> haven’t even been officially announced yet, but many folks treat them as confirmed entries on the studio’s upcoming slate. There are some that still manage to slip the community by, though, even if they might actually be far more concrete than others.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>Case in point, last December, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</a>‘ Destin Daniel Cretton signed a lucrative long-term deal with Marvel Studios. On top of directing Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and likely Shang-Chi 2, it was also reported (by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>) that he will helm a Disney Plus spin-off as well, which was said to be built around Shang-Chi’s sister Xialing, as played by Meng’er Zhang.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>Things had gone cold on that front since then, so we pretty much forgot all about it, but according to the latest intel, the Xialing show was still in development at the House of Ideas prior to the strikes taking effect. So, as far as we know, it remains a-go. As per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Updates</a>:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tweet_1694403125417771185_20230824_125807_via_10015_io.png><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>Coming out when theaters were still recovering from the pandemic, Shang-Chi only made $432 million at the box office (tremendous for any other studio, not outstanding for Marvel), but it was warmly received by the fandom and has gone down as one of the best-reviewed of the MCU’s origin stories. So it’s no surprise that a sequel and a spin-off supposedly remain in the works.</p><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=900 data-injectable=false>There’s certainly lots to explore with Xialing in her own vehicle, given that she took over from her father, Wenwu (Tony Leung), as the new leader of the Ten Rings organization in Shang-Chi‘s post-credits scene. She’s now one of the most powerful people in the criminal underworld of Earth-616, then, so the storytelling and crossover potential there is extremely intriguing. Even so, with Cretton’s commitments to Avengers 5, any expansion of the Shang-Chi-verse is likely a ways away.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmqqmhnqSzp3nTqGSapl2qu6Wx0auYrZ2UYoF0foymoKWkmaS7brnCrmSmp6aesm7Ax5qrZrGfqnqprcNmpahlmZmyonnWmqpmoJGlvaa6yKeeZpmgpa6zsc2to7Jlo6m2rbiMoqpo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brian-villegas-net-worth-293735.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brian Villegas Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tory-burch-booties-sale-booties-nordstrom.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>So Many Tory Burch Boots Are Half Off at Nordstrom</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
