The teenager stunned the judges with her voice, earned herself a standing ovation, and ultimately, the golden buzzer.</p><p class=Fg>"America's Got Talent" season 17 episode 3 auditions were power-packed with Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum, Howie Mandel, and Sofia Vergara on the judges' panel. The auditions featured nail-biting and comedic moments while serving thrilling entertainment.</p><p class=Fg>The comedic moment came when "America's Got Talent: Extreme" judge Nikki Bella and her sister Brie Bella pranked the judges. The sisters, known as WWE Bella Twins, gave a terrible performance, with the crowd booing them before they started fighting on stage.</p><p class=Fg>Sadly, Mandel had to leave the show early as he got sick in the middle of the auditions. There were many talented competitors from a deaf comedian, a dance group, a ventriloquist, a circus artist, the knife act, and more.</p><p class=Fg>However, the night's highlight was when a contestant got the golden buzzer from Cowell. Before James got the golden buzzer, she had <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tvinsider.com/1048424/americas-got-talent-season-17-episode-3-auditions/>performed</a> Billie Eilish's "Lovely" and hoped to live the "American dream." Here are some facts about James.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>WHERE IS SARA JAMES FROM?</strong></p><p class=Fg>James grew up in Ośno Lubuskie, a small town in Poland. She was born to a Pole mother, Arleta Dancewicz, and a Nigerian father, singer, and producer, John Egwu-James. James inherited her father's musical talent and learned to play piano at age six.</p><p class=Fg>The golden buzzer winner turned 14 on June 10, 2022, so she was 13 at her first audition for the "America's Got Talent" judges. However, this is not her first time on a reality competition series.</p><p class=Fg>James, who looks up to so many female artists, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/who-is-sara-james-agt-season-17-4766668/>competed</a> in season 4 of the Polish version of the reality and talent show "The Voice Kids." She won the season with coaches Tomson and Baron.</p><p class=Fg>She has also competed on a global stage and represented Poland in the "Junior Eurovision Song Contest" in 2021. For the competition, James sang "Somebody," an upbeat pop track with lyrics and music by Patryk Kumór and Dominik Buczkowski-Wojtaszek, and she came in second.</p><p class=Fg>At the "America's Got Talent" auditions, Cowell sent James straight to the live shows by pushing the coveted golden buzzer. Cowell <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/americas-got-talent-simon-cowell-praises-golden-buzzer-winning-act-sara-james/>said</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"I pushed my golden buzzer for Sara because she is, in my opinion, a total star. She flew across the world to audition on AGT 'to see if dreams come true.'"</p><p class=Fg>After pushing the buzzer, Cowell <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZb-nym3HhA">told</a> the dedicated artist, who had <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://junioreurovision.tv/participant/sara-james-2021>honed</a> her vocal talents at the Słubice Municipal Cultural Center in Poland, that he wanted to make that moment one she would never forget.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/b0bdab979ff8ad10ec5825ee93747f4c.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Madison Taylor Baez at the 21st Annual Cinémoi Oscars Party on February 9, 2020 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>WHO GOT THE GOLDEN BUZZER ON AGT</strong></p><p class=Fg>So far, James's golden buzzer became the third in Season 17 of "America's Got Talent."
