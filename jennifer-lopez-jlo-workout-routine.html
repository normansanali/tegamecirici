And the freedom I felt when I was flailing my arms around and dancing energetically in my living room was epic.</p><p id=eCE8OSKPpNGwd data-wc=38>Will I consider professional dancing? Probably not to be honest, purely due to time, but if I'm ever on holiday and I spot a salsa class taking place around the pool, then I'll be there like a shot.</p><h3><strong>High energy means more sleep</strong></h3><p id=eCKndAwxWxrej data-wc=33>My workouts tend to be a mix of slow resistance training and cardio, but J.Lo's routine was so energetic that I found myself falling asleep earlier than usual. And my sleep was deep!</p><p id=e9V3C-wrCS1xV data-wc=16>Without the sleep, I definitely don't think I’d have managed to pull myself through this week.</p><h3><strong>Timed workouts are great for busy lives</strong></h3><p id=eZv4REJ_oSgU2 data-wc=36>The lockdown workout that I did on Saturday was brilliant as I knew I had precisely 20 minutes to get it done so I worked 10 times harder as the finish line was never far away.</p><p id=eKrWFLDzfU91K data-wc=13>Plus, 20 minutes?
