And here’s everything that you need to know about her.</p><h3><strong>Yasmine Rabeea On Lovestruck High</strong></h3><p>Yasmine Rabeea was so happy to finally announce to the world that she had been to Lovestruck High. And the reason she went on this journey was to find someone who is on the same vibe as her and someone who wants to have an adventure just like her. She also disclosed that she decided to be part of the reality TV after she was done with her healing.</p><p>And once on Lovestruck, she quickly caught fellow contestant <a href=#>Max</a>‘s eyes. 23-year-old (as of 2021), Max is a personal trainer from Brentwood. Unlike most others, who kept their options open, Max seemed quite fixated on chasing Yasmine. He thought her personality and attributes were precisely what he wanted.</p><p>So, with the homecoming dance approaching them,&nbsp;Max gathered his courage to talk to Yasmine.</p><p>Their first meeting took place in a library and they learned they had a lot in common. At this point, Max also had asked Yasmine to attend the homecoming dance with him, and she happily accepted. In this way, Yasmin also started liking Max as she realized he is just her type. She even said that she finds him extremely cute and that the two of them get all gooey and lovey-dovey while talking to each other.</p><p>Again, at the homecoming dance, viewers saw them cozy up to each other. They stood out also as one of the few honest couples who did not have their eyes wandering elsewhere.</p><p>Yasmine who otherwise never kissed on the first date ended up sharing a passionate kiss. Her relationship with Max only flourished further in the following episodes, and fans guessed that they might go all the way to the end.

Both follow each other on social media and have maintained a friendly relationship with the rest of their castmates. Yet, they have rarely interacted with each other in the public sphere.</p><h3><strong>Yasmine Rabeea Ethnicity</strong></h3><p>Yasmine Rabeea is likely an Algerian as this is where she claims to come originally come from.
