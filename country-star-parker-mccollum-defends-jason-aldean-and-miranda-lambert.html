He was performing in Las Vegas in 2017 <a href=#>when a gunman opened fire, killing 58 and injuring 546</a>. <a href=#><strong>Sheryl Crow</strong></a> was among <a href=#>many vocal critics of the song’s messaging</a>.</p><p>Aldean addressed the backlash in a social media statement on Tuesday. “In the past 24 hours I have been accused of releasing a pro-lynching song (a song that has been out since May) and was subject to the comparison that I (direct quote) was not too pleased with the nationwide BLM protests. These references are not only meritless, but dangerous,” he wrote, shutting down claims that the lyrics promote racist ideology.</p><p>He continued: “There is not a single lyric in the song that references race or points to it- and there isn’t a single video clip that isn’t real news footage -and while I can try and respect others to have their own interpretation of a song with music — <a href=#>this one goes too far</a>.”</p><p>Lambert, for her part, caused a stir on Sunday, July 17, when she stopped her Las Vegas residency concert <a href=#>to scold a few fans for taking selfies</a> during her song “Tin Man.”</p><p>“I’m gonna stop right here for a second, I’m sorry. These girls are worried about their selfie and not listening to the song,” she told the audience, according to a TikTok clip shared after the show. “It’s pissing me off a little bit. Sorry, <a href=#>I don’t like it. At all</a>.”</p><p>In the video, several concertgoers got up and <a href=#>left after the uncomfortable incident</a>. “Let’s go. Come on. You don’t do that to fans,” one attendee said.</p><p>McCollum, however, backed up Lambert’s actions by <a href=#>retweeting a video on Sunday that showed the fans in question using a bright flash</a> and disrupting the crowd with a full-on photo shoot before the “Bluebird” singer called them out.</p><p>“To all the ppl coming for her. #MirandaLambert,” the original poster captioned the clip.</p><p>The “Hell of a Year” singer <a href=#>later reshared an old video of Lambert bringing a young fan named Remy on stage</a> with her as an example of the singer’s influence. “Do you wanna sing this song with me?” Lambert asked the little girl in the clip. She held Remy’s hand and broke down in tears as they sang together.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lambert has not publicly commented on the mid-show drama, but <a href=#>a source exclusively told Us Weekly</a> on Tuesday that “there is a level of respect that is expected” from the audience when Lambert takes the stage.</p><p>“She understands fans are there to have fun, but she hopes people focus more on the show and being in the moment than using the opportunity to promote social media,” the insider said, adding, “Miranda is, and always has been, incredibly grateful for her fans and she feels blessed to have such dedicated followers.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacp6WjwbPFjKyrmqpdpa6zt8SrZKabk6S5rcHMZpuenpWjsbR5yZqqqKZdlrmlscCnZJqmlGK6qr7Ap5uaZZyWuqOx0a1m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./deacon-jones-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Deacon Jones Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./20010528774394.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>CARLOS MENEM WEDS EX-BEAUTY-QUEEN CECILIA BOLOCCO IN A LOW-KEY CEREMONY</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
