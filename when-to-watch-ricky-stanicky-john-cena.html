Dean (Zac Efron), JT (<strong>Andrew Santino</strong>), and Wes (<strong>Jermaine Fowler</strong>) have always tried their best to be there for their best friend, Ricky Stanicky. Always out of town and constantly dealing with health complications, their significant others and families don't suspect a thing when Dean, JT, and Wes go to visit Ricky.

However, a lie of this magnitude can only last for so long, and the trio's families start to suspect that something is off about their imaginary drinking buddy. Desperate to keep up appearances, the three get the wild idea of hiring an actor to play Ricky Stanicky to trick their families further. They find one in an eccentric actor named Rod (<a href=#><strong>John Cena</strong></a>), who finds himself perhaps getting a bit too into the role for his own good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can probably guess how this latest attempt of these three to scam their families is going to go, but the question is whether this comedic caper will unfold on the big screen or streaming.
