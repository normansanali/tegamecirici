Taking over for iconic '90s Wednesday played by Christina Ricci who so famously burned down a Thanksgiving play in Addams Family Values, is You actress Jenna Ortega. Wednesday introduces us to many fairly <a href=# rel=nofollow>new faces including Hunter Doohan, Joy Sunday, Emma Myers and more</a>.While Christina Ricci appears as a different character in the series, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman take over as Morticia and Gomez Addams. Despite evoking nostalgia for longtime Addams Family fans, <a href=# rel=nofollow>the series is not intended to be a reboot</a>. But, with a renewed interest in the Tim Burton films, we decided to take a look at the actors who starred in The Addams Family movies; here’s what they are doing now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-elizabeth-wilson><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>What Happened To Elizabeth Wilson?</span></h2><p>After playing Abigail Craven in The Addams Family, Elizabeth Wilson starred in many other movies and TV shows including The Boys Next Door (1996), and Rocky Road (2001).
