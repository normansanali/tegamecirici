Fittingly - given that the animal lovers first met at a horse show - their loyal steeds played a starring role in the day.</p><p id=e3BLxh_K_DQ data-wc=27>Amber tells Hello! she couldn't have imagined marrying anywhere else but High River, where the show is also filmed, and her cherished ranch was the obvious venue.</p><p id=epQCEaPZHwu data-wc=18>"I'm a homebody and so is Shawn," she says.

"We were our own wedding planners, and it wasn't stressful for me," says the native of London, Ontario.</p><p id=eeLHPGHpE3RY data-wc=37>With supportive loved ones willing to pitch in, the big day was filled with personal touches, like the altar, which was hand-crafted by Shawn himself. "The altar was the most beautiful memento of our day," says Amber.</p><p id=evHvyjh2rtL7 data-wc=69>It also set the stage for her favourite part of the occasion - arriving on horseback to meet her groom. Wearing a strapless gown by Private Label by G and carrying a lilac bouquet arranged by her grandmother, Amber made a stunning entrance on her horse, Hawk, riding sidesaddle as her father - who only learned to work with the horse moments before the ceremony - held the reigns.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fa024d08afbf-body11-z.jpg><p id=evMA98tP36kb data-wc=29>The television actress is used to being in the spotlight, but exchanging vows with her groom in front of 150 of their loved ones presented an entirely new thrill.</p><p id=e4_Zj12dJN6Q data-wc=26>"I was emotional. I thought, 'I can't believe this is real!'" she said. "I thought I'd be more nervous but it was a lot of fun."</p><p id=e_iC-rS-2ClZ data-wc=53>Following their first kiss as husband and wife, the bride and groom saddled up and galloped away - if not quite into the sunset, at least toward the reception. "The applause made the horses a little nervous," recalls Amber. "So they went off a little quicker than usual. It was quite an exit!"</p><p class=caption id=eqtQFriOPr1i data-wc=6>CLICK THE IMAGE FOR THE GALLERY:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bcdba8b05be7-body53-z.jpg><p id=e2iYoRYd2Pi9 data-wc=33>That evening, under big white tends, guests sat down to toast the newlyweds. After tucking into a meal prepared by the same caterers who work on Heartland, Amber's off- and on-set families mingled.</p><p id=eZsxECTs_fas data-wc=59>Having co-workers like Michelle Morgan and Chris Potter there was especially meaningful to Amber because in the six years that the show has aired, they've become family to her as well. "I don't have a sister, but having Michelle there, who plays my sister on the show, was so important to me. It was like having a sister there."</p><p id=ePErh0SxwuS5 data-wc=41>The low-key bride wanted her guests to feel completely at ease, which meant leaving stiff formal wear and stilettos at home. "Some people wore jeans and boots, full western attire," she says. "I wanted everyone to be casual and have fun."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4e1229ac1b02-body53-z.jpg><p id=ePpSHHH46NP7 data-wc=34>Amber created a play list that made her guests glad they could hit the floor in comfort - but first she and her husband shared their first dance to Garrett Hedlund's "Timing is Everything."</p><p id=eGmsUyHymm3v data-wc=35>When it came time for speeches, each of their fathers spoke. Then Amber's TV father, Chris Potter, had his chance to toast the bride and groom as the close-knit cast joined in wishing them well.</p><p id=eloWzgeHDCbS data-wc=32>As cameras are already rolling on the latest season of Heartland, Amber and Shawn have put honeymoon plans on hold. "He has a lot on the go, just like me," Amber says.</p><p id=eamBil54dqGq data-wc=20>No matter what lies ahead for her character on the small screen, Amber's own long-running love story has just begun.</p><p id=ev-w5M5UueFc data-wc=4>Photos: José Paulo MPA</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQbmdsa2Bmf3h%2FkW9moZ2Rp8Gtrc2dZJqbpKeytL%2BMmqSbnaJiuqK%2B0qGYpaRdqHqzwdKtoJxlopa7pLSMsJydnJmjtHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./first-look-as-christian-bale-netflix-mystery-the-pale-blue-eye.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Heres your first look as Christian Bale in eerie Netflix mystery The Pale Blue Eye</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gilbert-gottfried-net-worth-147718.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gilbert Gottfried Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
