In that game, Lock threw for 269 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions.</p><p>Midweek, there was some optimism about Smith’s recovery. Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll shared, “He made it through with the work that he’s done. He’s still questionable, and we’ll wait and see what happens on game day.”</p><p>Carroll also provided an update, saying, “[Smith] feels really good. He threw the heck out of the ball in the morning session, so we’ll see what happens today with the hope that he’s ready to go. He was able to do stuff. He threw the ball all week.”</p><p>Unfortunately, Smith hasn’t fully recovered, and Drew Lock will once again serve as Seattle’s starting quarterback.</p><p>Playing in San Francisco is notoriously challenging in the NFL, and it won’t get any easier with the arrival of the Eagles for Lock. When asked about Lock’s experience against the 49ers, Carroll told the media, “We’ve talked all about it, hung out just talking about what the experience was like, and how he feels differently.”</p><p>Carroll continued, “So if he’s called on, he’ll be in just a clear mindset because of what he went through. It was a very difficult game. A challenging game last week, and he made it through it. He handled it really well and came out of it with a clear mind and all, so that’s only going to be beneficial for him.”</p><p>The Week 15 game against the Eagles is crucial for the Seahawks, who are currently on a four-game losing streak. With a 6-7 record, they’ve fallen behind in the NFC playoff picture. To have any chance of making the playoffs, the Seahawks need to start a winning streak.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifLOx1Z6YpZ2UYsSprdNmn5qooJq7prCMraZmn5WjvG6%2FzKKroWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sade-plays-sexy-housewife-in-sultry-new-clip-2010125.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sade Plays Sexy Housewife in Sultry New Clip</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./murphy-is-getting-crucified-after-leaked-text-messages-with-aalyah-mysterio-on-wwe-raw.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Murphy Is Getting Crucified After Leaked Text Messages With Aalyah Mysterio On WWE RAW</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
