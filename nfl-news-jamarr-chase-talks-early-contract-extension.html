Naturally, the fans are already looking ahead to the next season. Fans and experts are now wondering how <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ja’Marr Chase</a></strong>‘s contract extension will work out, especially since the Bengals also have to hand a new contract to their other star wide receiver <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tee Higgins</a></strong>.</p><p>During Thursday’s press conference, reporters asked Ja’Marr Chase about his plans for a contract extension with the Bengals and whether he is planning to take a pay cut. Chase said he is looking to get the extension done in the upcoming off-season itself, instead of taking it to the next season.</p><pre class=wp-block-verse>Lord knows,&nbsp;I want to do that. I mean, but we’ll see what happens.</pre>Chase told reporters<p>Furthermore, he was also asked whether he would be willing to take a pay cut that would allow the Bengals to keep their other star receiver Tee Higgins, who is currently playing in the last year of his rookie deal.</p><pre class=wp-block-verse>That's a good question. Who knows? It depends on how much I'm taking. It depends at the end of the day, because then I might not really be taking a cut. It might come from somewhere else.</pre>Chase said on Thursday<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#Bengals</a> WR Ja’Marr Chase says that he wants his money up front this offseason. He also wonders whether Tee Higgins might return with him.</p><p>“It depends on how much I’m taking.”<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/TlUwPKzWkN</a></p>— Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) <a href=#>January 5, 2024</a></figure><p>The 23-year-old wide receiver — who struggled with some injuries throughout the season — caught a career-high 96 passes for 1,197 receiving yards and 7 touchdowns. In his three years in the league, Chase has received three Pro Bowl nods, three 1000-plus receiving yards, and has been named to the second-team All-Pro squad 1 time.</p><p>Chase still has one year left in his rookie deal and the Bengals also have a choice to pick his 5th-year option. He also said he is waiting for his former <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LSU</a> teammate <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justin Jefferson</a></strong> to get his contract done. Chase believes Jefferson could change the market for the wide receivers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bengals-would-prioritize-ja-marr-chase-over-tee-higgins><strong>Bengals would prioritize Ja’Marr Chase over Tee Higgins</strong></h2><p>The Bengals have a big problem ahead of them. Just a year after they handed out a massive contract to their franchise quarterback <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Burrow</a></strong>, now they have to find a way to keep both Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/JaMarr-Chase.jpg><p>But, they will be prioritizing Chase over Higgins since the former has certainly made a bigger impact on the organization compared to the latter. Besides, Higgins also had one of the worst campaigns of his career, which will give the Bengals an upper hand in the negotiations.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Nonetheless, they will take care of it in the upcoming off-season. For now, they will be focused on defeating their AFC North opponents <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cleveland Browns</a>, who they are scheduled to face this weekend.</p><p><strong>In case you missed:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZ%2BjZqaVrMButsCmmKuqXZi1or%2FEZquapJuoeqat0aWwZpufo8GzrcKtZJ6wpJq7tLXOp2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./candise-zepherin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Candise Zepherin - Bio, Career, Net Worth, Height, Married, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anthony-eustrel.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anthony Eustrel</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
