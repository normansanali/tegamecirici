The latest Marvel film follows Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). In the midst of trying to reconnect with his daughter Cassie (Kathyn Newton) after going missing for five years, Scott and his loved ones are transported to the subatomic Quantum Realm.</p><p>Once there, Scott and company are caught up in a war of the realms against <a href=#>Kang the Conqueror</a> (Jonathan Majors), a being whose very existence threatens the multiverse at large.</p><p>The film introduces several new characters to the MCU, many of whom are classic comic characters who are making their cinematic debut.</p><p>Among them is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jentorra</a>, who is portrayed by <a href=#>Katy O'Brian</a>, making her one of few openly gay actors to appear in a Marvel Studios production.</p><p>Who is Jentorra in Quantumania?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Marvel Studios</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Jentorra in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania'?</h2><p>In Quantumania, Jentorra is introduced as she encounters Scott and Cassie in a city within the Quantum Realm. She is a rebel leader of the Freedom Fighters who oppose Kang, who has long ruled the Quantum Realm with an iron fist. She later leads an army in an uprising against Kang's forces.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with Marvel.com, actress Katy O'Brien was pleasantly surprised to discover that her character, who is relatively minor in the comics, got to play a pivotal role in the film.</p><p>"I thought it would be just a tiny, much smaller role," she admitted. "When I got to basically stick through the whole film, I was beside myself."</p><p>Katy even revealed that she contributed some input into how the character was portrayed. When it came to costuming, Katy insisted on having a cape in order to look more heroic. She was also incredibly excited to be a part of the universe.</p><p>"It was cool to sit there and exist in the same room as [the rest of the cast] and watch everyone crack jokes back and forth," she told Marvel.com.</p><p>Naturally, there is a fair share of similarities and differences between Jentorra on-screen and in the pages of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">comic books</a>. In the original comics, Jentorra hails from the planet of K'ai and is a member of royalty. When her planet is in danger, she calls attempts to call upon the Hulk only to be met with the Hulk's violent son, Hiro-Kala. She later joins the Enigma Force in the fight to save her homeworld.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>She is more associated with the Hulk in the comics than with Ant-Man, but the film does take some cues from the comics in informing her character. Jentorra's home of K'ai is actually located in the Microverse, another name for the Quantum Realm in the comics, creating a precedence for Jentorra to be related to the Quantum Realm in the films.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKOdnqm8s77AZpinrF2irq950K6Yp6yloq6vtcA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kelly-ripa-mark-consuelos-striking-daughter-lola-aunt-double-fans-shocked-resemblance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kelly Ripa's striking daughter is her aunt's double as fans marvel over her beauty</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jlo-ben-affleck-montana-trip-details.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck Took Couple's Vacation to Montana</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
