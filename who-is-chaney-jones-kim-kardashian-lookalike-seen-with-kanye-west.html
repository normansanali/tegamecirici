After <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a> was spotted spending time with <strong>Chaney Jones</strong> multiple times this month, fans <a href=#>have been in awe of the striking resemblance</a> between the model and his estranged wife, <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>.</p><p>The rapper, 44, and the Instagram influencer have been <a href=#>photographed</a> spending time together in Miami, where West held another Donda 2 event on Tuesday, February 22.</p><p>Most recently, the pair were photographed on Thursday, February 24, shopping together in Bar Harbour, where Jones seemed to take the <a href=#><strong>Jay-Z</strong></a>/<a href=#><strong>Rihanna</strong></a>/<strong>West</strong> <a href=#>“Run This Town” lyric,</a> “All black everything,” to heart. She sported a form-fitting black catsuit complete with black sneakers and a black purse. She wore silver, mirrored sunglasses.</p><p>Just one day before, the social media personality was caught on camera in a cream-colored jumpsuit — this time, wearing the same sunglasses Kardashian herself donned at a Donda party in 2021.</p><p>West was first spotted with Jones, his invited guest, at<a href=#>&nbsp;his Los Angeles Donda 2 listening party</a> on February 7.</p><p>At the time, the Instagram influencer channeled Kardashian, 41, <a href=#>in another all-black catsuit ensemble</a>. A source exclusively told Us Weekly that the event was also attended by <a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Travis Scott</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Drake</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Offset</strong></a>.</p><p>Eagle-eyed fans later noticed that Jones has previously posted an Instagram photo with the caption, “his muse.” The public outing comes after the Yeezy designer called out the Skims founder <a href=#>for not including him in important parenting decisions.</a></p><p>“SINCE THIS IS MY FIRST DIVORCE I NEED TO KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO ABOUT MY DAUGHTER BEING PUT ON TIK TOK AGAINST MY WILL ?” West wrote via Instagram on Friday, February 4, after previously voicing concerns with his daughter North, 8, having a social media account.</p><p>The beauty mogul, for her part, <a href=#>accused the musician of “constant attacks” against her online</a> since their split.</p><p>“As the parent who is the main provider and caregiver for our children, I am doing my best to protect our daughter while also allowing her to express her creativity in the medium that she wishes with adult supervision — because it brings her happiness,” Kardashian said in her own Instagram post that same day. “I wish to handle all matters regarding our children privately and hopefully he can finally respond to the third attorney he has had in the last year to resolve any issues amicably.”</p><p>West, <a href=#>who also shares Saint, 6, Chicago, 4, and Psalm, 2, with Kardashian</a>, continued to address his issues with the KKW Beauty founder before deleting all his posts on social media on Sunday, February 6.</p><p>The California native originally <a href=#>filed for divorce in February 2021 after six years of marriage</a>. In December 2021, the businesswoman legally requested to be <a href=#>declared legally single amid her divorce</a>. Since the breakup, Kardashian has moved on with <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, West recently broke up with <a href=#><strong>Julia Fox</strong></a>, whom he met on New Year’s Eve. That same month, the Uncut Gems actress, 32, <a href=#>discussed the idea of being the “Jesus Walks” artist’s “muse” </a>since they first met.</p><p>For her part, <a href=#>Fox openly admitted to being a fan of the Kardashian-Jenner family</a> in December 2021, right before she met the father of four.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I have been watching Keeping Up since it first came out in 2007 when, like, watching it was embarrassing,” she revealed on her Forbidden Fruits podcast at the time. “I wanted them to be my family. … You feel like you know them.”</p><p>Scroll down for everything to know about Jones:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkxKm7jKKqZpuYlrumxYyjpqedo2K4qrmMpJirnJGotaqtzWajqKeblrmqt8Rmqp6dnmLEqsDHZqKapqmaerix0q1m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ajith-kumar.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ajith Kumar</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-selling-sunset-star-nicole-youngs-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Selling Sunset star Nicole Youngs net worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
