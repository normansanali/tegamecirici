Blige, but while it’s still unclear exactly how much they stand to make from his “acquisitions or investments” (on which they’re apparently spending $25 million), it’s unlikely that any of this will make up for the $10 million per album (for a minimum of three albums) he’ll get over the next ten years, or the $25 million he’ll get to found his own label, or the $25 million upfront payment that Jay makes just for signing the deal.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-72718e59adf285656b95769e8757fd57-3-0-0@published data-word-count=89>Also bad for Live Nation is that Jay-Z is still under contract to Def Jam for an album (which he says he’ll deliver late this year), meaning the soonest he could start recording for LN is next year, when he’ll be 39. Last year’s American Gangster barely sold a million copies (despite being awesome), so it’s probably unlikely that the albums he makes between 2009 and 2018 (after which most CD factories will have closed and he and Beyoncé start having grandchildren) will earn back their $30 million cost.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-72718e59adf285656b95769e8757fd57-4-0-0@published data-word-count=52>But hey, maybe profits from a new clothing line (he sold Rocawear last year for $204 million), his chain of 40/40 nightclubs, or a line of Rocafella action figures (which we would totally buy) will make this a winning deal after all. Either way, though, props to Jay-Z for getting $150 million!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-72718e59adf285656b95769e8757fd57-5-0-0@published data-word-count=10><a href=#>In Rapper’s Deal, a New Model for Music Business</a> [NYT]</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-72718e59adf285656b95769e8757fd57-6-0-0@published data-word-count=11><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Who Belongs on Mount Rapmore?</a><br><a href=#>Madonna and Mariah Carey Dethrone Elvis</a></p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Live Nation Signs Idiotic Deal With 38-Year-Old Rap Star</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlncWdgaXyttdWelqeZpJ68r6vSop6nq4%2Besaq706KamJyVlrlvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meghan-trainor-candy-crush-saga-made-you-look-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meghan Trainor Talks Candy Crush Saga Collab &amp;amp; Made You Look Video Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kobi-karp-net-worth-wikipedia-how-much-does-he-worth-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kobi Karp Net Worth Wikipedia: How Much Does He Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
