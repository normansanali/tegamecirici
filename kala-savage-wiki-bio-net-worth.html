All three brothers got the gift of musical talent. Similarly, the Savage siblings successfully left their marks in the Hollywood industry with their creativity. Fred Savage dominated the TV industry in the Late 80s by appearing in the famous TV series ‘The Wonder Years.’ Likewise, Ben Savage did the same in the late 90s and early 00s by starring in the hit TV series ‘Boy Meets World.’ And the sister&nbsp;Kala Savage made an impact in the industry working on camera. The actress has appeared in various TV series. Let’s get to know a bit more about her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life and Childhood</h2><p>Kala was born on October 16, 1978, in Highland Park, Illinois. She had a typical and financially stable childhood as her parents worked as real estate agents and consultants. She grew up with her two brothers, Fred and Ben happily. Her grandparents were Jewish from Poland, Germany, Ukraine, and Latvia. All the siblings were raised in a strict Reform Judaism.&nbsp;Her education qualifications still need to be made public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kala-Savage.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Career</h2><p>The actor started her career when she was young when she appeared as a little monster in the movie ‘Little Monsters’&nbsp; (1980), while her brothers played Eric and Brian. The adorable siblings looked adorable playing in the film. However, the movie didn’t do too remarkably, scoring 6.3 on IMDB and 80% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Later the same year, she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared</a> in the soap opera ‘Santa Barbara’ in 1989 as Anissa for 6 episodes in the fifth season.
