The information blew up and social media users instantly sought this opportunity to make a dozen memes. The nanny made several shocking claims.&nbsp;</p><p>The woman who once watched over <a href=# rel>Olivia Wilde</a> and Jason Sudeikis' children shared how the 'Ted Lasso' got so emotionally devastated when he found that his fiancee, 38, had prepared her special salad with a "special dressing." In a desperate attempt to stop her from seeing the former <a href=# rel>One Direction member</a>, Sudeikis threw himself in front of the car. The nanny, who chose to remain anonymous, to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Daily Mail</a> that once Sudeikis, 47, "lashed out and chased after Olivia after she had prepared a salad for Styles with ‘special dressing’ in their kitchen." The nanny further claimed, “He burst out at Wilde before lying under the car to stop her from leaving." Lately, the cheating scandal has been blowing up ever since the director got served with custody papers while she was on stage promoting 'Don't Worry Darling'.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Jason Sudeikis lay 'under the car' to stop Olivia Wilde from seeing Harry Styles, claims ex-nanny</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Harry Styles jokes during MSG concert that he went to Venice 'to spit on Chris Pine'</a></p><p>The nanny also claimed that the 'We're The Millers' actor discovered Wilde's affair with the 'Don't Worry Darling' actor after he came across some messages between them on her Apple watch that she had left behind. As per the claims, Sudeikis was left emotionally unstable and started drinking heavily. The nanny also made a strong claim that it was Olivia Wilde who made the first move when she kissed Harry Styles during one of the dinners for the cast in Palm Springs. The Internet, however, is seemingly interested in what the salad contained and what the "special dressing" was made of. Following these claims, the duo released a joint statement as reported by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a> slamming their nanny and saying, "As parents, it is incredibly upsetting to learn that a former nanny of our two young children would choose to make such false and scurrilous accusations about us publicly. Her now 18 month long campaign of harassing us, as well as loved ones, close friends and colleagues, has reached its unfortunate apex. We will continue to focus on raising and protecting our children with the sincere hope that she will now choose to leave our family alone."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/9035ce2d-6316-4e8a-873f-16e06561bb13.927264796> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/b66e02e6-40e4-4e1a-9218-4fbf8692b1e4.1397943778><h2 class=split>Internet goes CRAZY after hearing about Olivia Wilde's salad</h2><p>The people could not help but wonder about what was so special about Wilde's salad with a special dressing that sent Sudeikis in such a rage that he allegedly laid in front of her fiancee's car so that she does not go see Harry Styles.
