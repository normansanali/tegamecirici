When asked about how he viewed Seth Rollins ten years ago when they shared the ring at Royal Rumble 2014, Punk said he believed Rollins was a guy who was following in his footsteps.</p><p>“I viewed Seth as somebody who was following my footsteps,” CM Punk said. “I think there’s a lot of people in wrestling as a whole that are in WWE now who, for better or for worse, looked up to a guy like me. I always like to thank the legends that helped pave the way for the roads that I travel now. Guys like Terry Funk, Eddie Guerrero, Bret Hart, Tracy Smothers, Chris Candido.</p><p>“There’s a litany of guys that I always feel that I wouldn’t have gotten the opportunities that I got if it weren’t for them. I don’t know. I guess I’m in a position where, it feels maybe strange, me vocalizing it. But I think Seth is a guy, at least, I definitely thought it ten years ago. That he’s a dude that I don’t think would have gotten the opportunities that he’s gotten if it wasn’t for me. That might hurt some people’s feelings, but facts are facts, they don’t care about your feelings.”</p><h2 id=h-will-cm-punk-go-after-seth-rollins-if-he-wins-the-royal-rumble>Will CM Punk go after Seth Rollins if he wins the Royal Rumble?</h2><p>When asked about their face-to-face promo on WWE RAW a few weeks ago where Rollins said he hated him, Punk said how Rollins feels about him is none of his business.</p><p>“What Seth honestly feels about me is none of my business, that’s how I approach it,” CM Punk said. “Maybe he’s jealous, maybe he’s envious, it’s not for me to decide and figure out. Luckily, there is a ring. And a lot of times, when you have differences with somebody, you get to settle it in the ring. The Rumble is in my immediate future. If Seth is still champion by the time that is all said and done and the dust clears, maybe we can talk again about it. And maybe we can settle things in the ring.”</p><p><a href=#>CM Punk On His WWE Return: Everything Happened That Day So Fast, Nobody Knew</a></p><p>What do you make of CM Punk’s overall comments?
