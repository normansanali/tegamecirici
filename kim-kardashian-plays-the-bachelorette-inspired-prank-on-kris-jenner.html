An executive from Disney [<strong>Rob Mills</strong>] called me. They wanted to talk to me directly and I was going to connect them with [Kris] once I decided if I was going to do it or not. I am going to do The Bachelorette,” the Skims founder teased to her loved ones. “They are going to do it in Malibu. That is so close by. I thought this through and I thought it was so much fun.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kim-Kardashian-Tricks-Kris-Jenner-Into-Calling-Disney-VP-Over-Fake-The-Bachelorette-Gig-A-Prank-272.jpg><p>Kris, 67, however, was not thrilled by the news that Kim <a href=#>made a business decision without her</a>. The momager ultimately called the Executive Vice President of Unscripted Entertainment at Walt Disney to learn more information about the opportunity.</p><p>“I just need to wrap my head around something like this because this isn’t exactly the space I saw Kim in. And she does have four kids and a busy life,” Kris said about Kim, who <a href=#>shares daughters North, 10, and Chicago, 5, and sons Saint, 7, and Psalm, 4,</a> with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>. “I watch the show. I love the show! But did I want my daughter on it? Oh, hell no.”</p><p>In response, the Disney executive — who was in on the joke — <a href=#>reassured Kris about the potential gig</a>, adding, “We are working on all the scheduling right now and we are about 90 percent there. For Kim, [the budget] is subject to negotiation. We would probably need to work with you on that.”</p><p>The KKW Beauty founder ultimately broke the news to Kris that she was pulling a prank on her. Before Kim revealed the truth, <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> weighed in on her older sister’s <a href=#>interest in finding The One on a reality show</a>.</p><p>“Kim, absolutely not should you be on The Bachelorette. First of all, you barely drink so you don’t know how to be drunk. They won’t let you have your glam team — I can guarantee you that,” Khloé, 39, said in a confessional. “And you are going to be making out with random people all day? That sounds gross.”</p><p>Kris and Khloé ultimately laughed off the prank. Earlier in the season, Kim discussed <a href=#>trying to meet someone new following her high-profile divorce</a> from Kanye, 46.</p><p>“I just want to sneak around a little bit. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to sneak,” she shared in a June episode of the Hulu series. “It’s just hard [to date] because what do those first dates look like? They are behind [closed] doors [because] we can’t go out. It is kind of awkward. I just don’t want to date one person. This is my year.”</p><p>Kim has <a href=#>offered glimpses at her personal life after filing for divorce</a> from the rapper in February 2021 following six years of marriage. The former couple’s divorce <a href=#>was officially finalized nearly two years later</a> — in November 2022 — after a lengthy legal back and forth.</p><p>A source recently told Us Weekly that Kim was <a href=#>taking things slow with a mystery man</a>. (The aspiring lawyer was previously linked to <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a> but <a href=#>their relationship fizzled out in August 2022</a> after less than a year of dating.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Kim isn’t officially dating anybody, but there is somebody who she’s interested in. So far, there have only been subtle flirtations between them, but they haven’t gone out yet,” the insider shared in May. “She’s not ready to be seen out on a date with anybody for the time being because she doesn’t want to make it a big deal. She knows once she’s seen on a date then things get blown out of proportion quickly, but there is somebody special she has her eye on so she’s excited about where things could go.”</p><p>Hulu releases new episodes of The Kardashians every Thursday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYr2trdisZK2glWKvoq%2FHnqOoqpWpwaZ5yKeqqaGimrFuvNGapaRln6N6rL7IrGSjnZ6jsrN7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./maika-monroe.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Maika Monroe Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Facts, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./khary-payton-height-how-tall-is-khary-payton.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Khary Payton Height: How tall is Khary Payton?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
