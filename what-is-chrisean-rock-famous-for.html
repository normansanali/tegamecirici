In fact, part of the reason why people are so interested in her private life is that she started out in the industry as a rapper, which meant more eyes were on her than the average social media influencer or <a href=#><strong>TikTok</strong></a>er.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over time, Chrisean grew an audience of fans who became concerned about her wellbeing after <a href=#>she announced she was pregnant with Blueface's baby</a>. Given her and Blueface's spats, people have followed the rapper and worried about not just her safety, but her ability to care for herself and her baby. It turns out those worries might be for nothing.</p><h2 id=what-does-chrisean-rock-do-for-a-living>What Does Chrisean Rock Do For A Living?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chrisean-rock-in-her-music-video-for-vibes.jpg><p>Most sources seem to agree that Chrisean Rock's career began with her debut as a social media influencer when she was a recent high school graduate (and still underage). It's unclear whether she had modeling or sponsorship gigs from the outset, but in 2018, Chrisean appeared on Ultimate Tag, a game show that played up her athletic abilities (she was a track athlete prior to the show).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After seeing old footage of her track days, many fans lamented that Chrisean didn't pursue sports as a career, but it seemed that she had another career in mind. In a trajectory that is quite <a href=#>similar to Cardi B's, complete with reality TV appearances</a> on her resume, Chrisean turned to social media.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Cardi B Wins Court Battle Against YouTuber Tasha K</a></span></p><p>Launching Instagram and YouTube accounts led Rock to start releasing makeup tutorial videos, which helped build up her following. However, her current YouTube channel only features her music, which seemed to be the next step in the influencer's career.</p><p>After branching into vlogging of different types, Chrisean began releasing music in 2020. Some time prior, in 2019, she connected with Blueface both professionally and personally. Throughout their off-on relationship, Chrisean has seemingly continued to make money moves independent of her sometimes-man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chrisean-has-a-net-worth-of-at-least-a-few-million-dollars>Chrisean Has A Net Worth Of At Least A Few Million Dollars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chrisean-rock-and-blueface.jpg><p>Figures on Chrisean Rock's exact net worth are hard to come by, as few publications have dived into her earnings and assets. Depending on which source is correct, if any, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrisean could have a net worth of anywhere from $2 million</a> to $8 million.</p><p>It's not too far-fetched to assume she has earned those millions from sponsorships and her influencer status, as it's unlikely her music has generated a regular income yet. To date, Rock has seemingly only released four songs.</p><p>Yet the rapper's Instagram showcases her attending events, including one with supposed-ex Blueface at the end of April 2023 in Memphis, Tennessee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title='TikTok Might Be To Blame For Chris Brown&#39;s Resurgence Despite Being "Canceled"'>TikTok Might Be To Blame For Chris Brown's Resurgence Despite Being "Canceled"</a></span></p><p>Fans weren't thrilled about that reveal, however, with many expressing their support and concern for Chrisean via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> comments amid all the drama surrounding her pregnancy. On the live performance announcement (which featured Chrisean hugging Blueface), commenters lamented the fact that her baby daddy was hosting the event.</p><p>One wrote, "We only coming to see you. Respecfully," while others encouraged her to keep pushing and working hard. Given that Chrisean was still scheduling events well into her pregnancy, some fans were a bit less supportive of her career ambition at the time.</p><p>A top-liked comment suggested Chrisean go home and "be pregnant" because they "know she tired." Chrisean, however, doesn't seem to plan to slow down during the pregnancy (or after).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-chrisean-rock-doing-for-work>What Is Chrisean Rock Doing For Work?</h2><p>Though her relationship drama might have disrupted Chrisean's ability to work with some companies as an influencer, not to mention her pregnancy probably threw a wrench in some of her gigs, the rapper isn't slowing down just because she has a baby on board.</p><p>In late February 2023, she captioned an Instagram video of a performance with, "All I gotta do is keep this going everywhere sold out fr y’all ready for tour?"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Exclusive: Top TikTok Creator Yahné Coleman Shares Her Tips For Next-Level Confidence</a></span></p><p>In late March, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrisean released a new song</a>, and fans applauded her work ethic and her honesty. Given that the new track gets raw about Chrisean's feelings and experiences, commenters left replies like, "I love how she doesn’t flex in her music. She talks about her real emotions."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another wrote, "She represents so many girls being let down in life and looking for love," while many noted that the scripture Chrisean included in her music video really resonated with them.</p><h2 id=did-chrisean-and-blueface-break-up>Did Chrisean And Blueface Break Up?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blueface-and-chrisean-rock-in-music-video-for-dear-rock.jpg><p>Given her recent song release, fans might assume that Chrisean and Blueface finally broke up for the last time. But because they're expecting a child together, it seems unlikely that Blueface will ever be out of her life.</p><p>Another sign that Chrisean might be cutting ties romantically with her ex is the fact that she is often seen with a gap between her teeth; not wearing the tooth that Blueface apparently got for her (she has one with his face on it) could be a sign.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, Chrisean seems to be planning bigger business moves to benefit herself and her baby; her Instagram bio features a link to a merchandise account, for a company name Chrisean's bio says she's the CEO of. Clearly, she doesn't need Blueface to make a living, but only time will tell whether they're really done.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecKhqaKrlZa7br7OnKJmnpGivLa%2FjJ%2Bmq2c%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wwe-news-hulk-hogans-ex-wife-was-allegedly-left-terror-struck-with-a-death-threat-at-airport-during-the-hulksters-absence.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hulk Hogans Ex-Wife Was Allegedly Left Terror-Struck With a Death Threat atAirport During the Hu</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./greek-chicken-gyros-with-tzatziki-sauce.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Greek Chicken Gyros with Tzatziki Sauce Modern Honey</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
