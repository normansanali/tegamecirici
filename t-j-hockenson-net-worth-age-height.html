Despite the setback, he managed to accumulate 61 catches for 583 yards and four touchdowns through 12 games.</p><p>In 2022, the Lions exercised their option to retain Hockenson for another year. During a game against the Seattle Seahawks, he broke a long-standing Lions record by amassing 179 receiving yards in a single game, solidifying his reputation as a top-tier tight end.</p><p>Hockenson’s journey took a new turn on November 1, 2022, when he was traded to the Minnesota Vikings in exchange for draft picks.
