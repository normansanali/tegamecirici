One day after announcing their <a href=#>band had broken up</a>, brothers <a href=#><strong>Kevin</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Joe</strong></a> and <strong><a href=#>Nick</a> </strong>appeared on <a href=#>Good Morning America</a> on Wednesday, Oct. 30 to explain their decision to call it quits.</p><p>"We feel like it's time that the Jonas Brothers comes to an end," Kevin, 25, told <strong><a href=#>Robin Roberts</a>.</strong></p><p>Youngest brother Nick, 21, confirmed reports that he was the one to initiate the breakup. "We're family first and that's always been our main priority and so honesty within what we do as a group was really important," he explained. "I came to the table with the guys…and shared my heart with them and my feelings. I said, 'Look, I feel like we've had some complications within the group for a long time [and] without addressing them I think this train will fall off the tracks.</p><p>"It was a tough conversation," Nick admitted. "It was the first time we really had that real conversation."</p><p>Earlier this month, the band <a href=#>cancelled their 19-date tour</a> just two days before the first show. "There is a deep rift within the band," their publicist, Jesse Derris, told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> at the time. "There was a big a disagreement over their music direction."</p><p>Joe, 24, explained to Roberts on GMA that their disagreements were mainly about their music. "It was just individual things that we were just butting heads about, whether it was the way to set up the music video or even just personal opportunities," he said. "At some point we decided it was best to finish this and support each other on our own ventures along the way."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The band, which formed in 2005, will not be finishing their fifth studio album, but do have a plan to give a proper goodbye to their fans. "We're going to release four of the unreleased songs from the album," Kevin shared. "And we put together the live tracks from the last summer tour — about 10 songs as well — so we'll be giving that to our fans club members, as a gift from us."</p><p>The New Jersey natives are looking forward to focusing on their individual endeavors, which include Kevin expecting a baby with wife <strong>Danielle</strong>, his E! reality show Married to Jonas and plans to work on the "business side" of the entertainment industry. Brothers Nick and Joe, meanwhile, plan to record their own music and focus on acting.</p><p>"I think we're really in a season right now of being excited about the future," Nick said, "but also there's a certain heaviness that comes with closing a chapter . . . It's impossible to say forever with anything, but I feel like we're playing it one step at a time right now and, like we said, rebuilding as brothers first and starting there."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp56WwG6u0airoZ2iqHqmxM%2BlmKKmXZe%2Fpq3Krqdmp55itLC7w2akqKqenruoecCmnKuhk5Z6uLGMsJyrnV2XwrXAyKeeZqCVlrG0eZFpaGxrYGZ9cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jonathan-bennett-weight-gain-before-and-after-photos-696351-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jonathan Bennett Weight Gain | Before And After Photos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jon-voight-net-worth-157252.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jon Voight Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
