Since then, Sandoval has been spotted with a couple of different women, including influencer Karlee Hale, though he’s denied being in a relationship and his rep told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> they were “just friends.”</p><h2 id=h-who-is-tom-sandoval-dating-now data-injectable=false>Who is Tom Sandoval dating now?</h2><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>Sandoval has been spotted with an aspiring musician named Tii since August 5, when they were first photographed leaving the Fleur Room in West Hollywood together. She was later identified by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> as Tii, a Los Angeles-based artist.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=623 data-injectable=true>A source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> that Sandoval and Tii met through their mutual friend Billie Lee, who viewers might recall from earlier seasons of Vanderpump Rules. “Tom and Tii had a lot of fun during their night out and there’s definitely a connection,” the source told the outlet. Another said, “He thought she was a really cool girl and they enjoyed getting to know each other.”</p><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>However, Sandoval denied being in a relationship with the singer, who dropped a new single “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Situatiionship</a>” just a couple of days before they were first spotted together. “That is just a friend of mine, dude,” he said in a video obtained by Backgrid, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a>. “You see me with somebody one time and all of a sudden we’re in a relationship? She’s just a friend of mine… I just want more positive female energy in my life. It’s been lacking for a while.”</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>Despite his comments, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> reported on September 11 that Sandoval was seen strolling hand-in-hand with Tii as the two headed to his apartment after a night out. The publication published the photos and reported that they had just left a West Hollywood bar together.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Backgrid (@backgrid_usa)</a></p></figure><h2 data-injectable=false>Where does Tom Sandoval stand with Raquel Leviss?</h2><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Whether Sandoval was hoping to rekindle his romance with Leviss or not, the former beauty pageant made her feelings clear about him when she blocked him on Instagram on September 12.
