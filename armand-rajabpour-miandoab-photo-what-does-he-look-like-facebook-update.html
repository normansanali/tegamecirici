Armand Rajabpour-Miandoab Photo.</strong></p><p>On Saturday, December 2, 2023, two people were gravely wounded and one person died as a consequence of a knife assault close to Paris’ famous Eiffel Tower.</p><p>The attacker, a French national of Iranian descent named Armand Rajabpour-Miyandoab, 26, was quickly captured after the attack.</p><p>Rajabpour-Miyandoab allegedly yelled “Allahu Akbar” throughout the rampage; this slogan is often connected to acts of terrorism.</p><p>Concerns over the incident’s possible links to extremist ideology were raised after the attacker further claimed credit for the crime in a video that was uploaded online.</p><p>The film, which has been shared across several internet channels, is terrifying evidence of the suspect’s stated intentions.</p><p>Investigations into the attack’s motivation are ongoing, but the tragedy has rekindled conversations about security protocols and the ongoing danger of terrorism in public areas.</p><p>The sad occurrence that occurred close to one of the most famous sites in the world highlights the difficulties that law enforcement has in stopping and dealing with violent crimes, leading to increased scrutiny and alertness in the aftermath of this frightening tragedy.</p><h2>Who Is Armand Rajabpour-Miandoab and Why Did He Do It?</h2><p>Since 2021, Armand Rajabpour-Miyandoab has been the subject of monitoring due to his active participation in a social media network that supports the Islamic State.</p><p>The French authorities recognized him as a radical Islamist with a history of mental health problems.</p><p>Rajabpour-Miyandoab had a criminal history before the previous incident, having been found guilty of theft and drug trafficking.</p><p>Unsettlingly, just before the assault, he posted a video on Facebook in which he swore loyalty to the Islamic State.</p><p>He also declared his intention to “punish the infidels” and “avenge the Prophet Muhammad.”</p><p>Facebook quickly deleted Rajabpour-Miyandoab’s video, which was motivated by other assaults in France, such as the truck attack in Nice in 2016 and the Charlie Hebdo killing in 2015.</p><p>Nonetheless, the information was circulated by jihadist accounts on Telegram and other platforms before its removal.</p><p>The incident is being investigated by the French anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office, which classifies it as a “terrorist plot.”</p><p>The case highlights the intricate relationship between criminal background, mental health conditions, and radicalization, underscoring the continuous difficulty authorities have in stopping and dealing with such threats.</p><h2>How Did the Paris Knife Attack Occur and Who Were the Victims?</h2><p>Before 11:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, a horrific incident happened close to the Eiffel Tower in Paris’s famous Champ de Mars park.</p><p>The attacker, who was carrying a knife and a hammer, randomly attacked people, killing a 45-year-old German visitor who was visiting Paris with his wife and two kids.</p><p>In addition, two French nationals, ages 28 and 32, who suffered serious injuries, are being treated at a hospital.</p><p>Officers on duty in the vicinity quickly responded by pursuing the assailant.</p><p>The attacker fought the arrest and cut one of the cops with his knife. After the authorities were able to subdue him, he is now being held.</p><p>The attack’s seriousness resonated across the world, causing shock and sadness.</p><p>As a “cowardly act of barbarism,” French President Emmanuel Macron criticized the incident and offered his condolences to the victims and their families.</p><p>Echoing the same feelings, German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her shock and sorrow for the unfortunate event.</p><p>The event highlights the continued difficulties police confront in maintaining public safety and stopping violent crimes in public areas.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":36992,"10":2,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>knife assault close to Paris' famous Eiffel Tower</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Valerie Haney Wikipedia And Age | Who Is Her Husband</a></h3>Haney, Valerie Wikipedia has drawn the attention of many people.
