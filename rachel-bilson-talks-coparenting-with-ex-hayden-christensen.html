So, for her to have another house to go to, I think that’s actually been helpful. So, all in all, it’s been good.”</p><p>Bilson met the Star Wars actor, also 39, on the set of their 2008 film, Jumper. They got engaged that December before quietly calling it off in August 2010. After the duo reconciled three months later, they went on to welcome their now-6-year-old daughter in October 2014.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rachel-Bilson-Talks-Coparenting-With-Ex-Hayden-Christensen.jpg><p>Us broke the news in September 2017 that <a href=#>Bilson and Christensen split after nearly 10 years together</a>. At the time, a source exclusively told Us that the now-exes were “on the outs for a couple of months” before their breakup became public news.</p><p>Since their split, the former Hart of Dixie star briefly dated <a href=#><strong>Bill Hader</strong></a>. They <a href=#>pumped the brakes in July</a> after less than a year of dating.</p><p>Last year, Bilson shared that <a href=#>when dating someone new, she immediately shares that she has a child</a> — and the man’s reaction determines a lot. “I always put it out there. She’s my world and I talk about her all the time. How f–ked up would it be if I hid that?” she said on <a href=#><strong>Nick Viall</strong></a>’s <a href=#>“The Viall Files” podcast</a> in 2019. “If you’re going to pursue something with someone, they have to be interested in the kid or be willing to be around the kid.”</p><p>Last December, the To Do List actress <a href=#>opened up about the challenges of raising her young one</a>. “Their voices are just very loud and present,” she told Us at the time. “She’s really good, though. I’m really lucky [but] there’s that common line of, ‘Well, Mommy, if you give me options, I’m going to give you options.’ She’s understanding and rebelling, like, ‘I don’t have to do this.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As a working actress and single mother, Bilson can count on her Amazon devices to get her through it. She revealed how they have helped her and her daughter while quarantining at home amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>“As far as keeping us entertained, I’m super indecisive. So, I have to talk about the Fire TV stick and I can just ask Alexa to decide for me basically,” she explained to Us. “That has been my saving grace. [Also] just staying connected with the video calls has really been helpful.”</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGarmZOdsq15waKjrKeeYsGiuMqsZJynoJa%2FprrToqWgZaeewal5xLFkoZmpmbKvecKhqaKrpJq7tLHNaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rush-hour-2-cast-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rush Hour 2 Cast Net Worth Richest Cast Members Salary</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./prince-william-shares-fact-home-life-children-pet-guinea-pigs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Prince William and Kate Middleton welcome new pets at Windsor home - details</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
