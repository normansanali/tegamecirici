After the <i>Flip or Flop </i>stars divorced, Tarek found love with <i>Selling Sunset </i>star <strong>Heather Rae El Moussa</strong>; they wed in October 2021 before welcoming son Tristan, 17 months. Hall, meanwhile, was married to <strong>Ant Antstead</strong>, with whom she shares 3-year-old son Hudson, before their 2021 split. She then wed <strong>Joshua Hall</strong> in April 2023.</p><p class=p1>Christina and Tarek, who ended <i>Flip or Flip </i>later that year, are preparing to team up again for another HGTV project. Alongside Josh, 43, and Heather, 36, the former couple will <a href=#>compete against one another</a> in <i>The Flip-Off </i>to design fixer-upper properties.</p><p class=p1>“The good thing about this show in particular is that it’s gonna be fun. It’s a competition,” Christina said on Tuesday. “There’s not gonna be any bad blood no matter what happens. None of us are taking it as seriously to actually get mad about stuff. We just decided to have fun with it no matter what. Because when you’re having fun filming that’s the most important thing, because that’s what the audience is gonna notice.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Christina-Hall-Says-Tarek-Relationship-Has-Definitely-Gotten-Better-01.jpg><p class=p1>Christina further noted that she and Josh only “just started” filming <i>The Flip-Off, </i>which the foursome pitched to HGTV themselves.</p><p class=p1>“Josh and I started flipping houses in Tennessee. I really missed flipping houses,” Christina said. “It was all of us talking together about what that looks like to do a house-flipping show together; [we] landed on the competition aspect because competition shows do really well for the network, in general. We brought that show to the network and they were super excited. It comes from a time of getting back into flipping and then the coparenting relationship going really well. We’re at a place where we could all do this together and still like each other after.”</p><p class=p1>According to Christina, <a href=#>coparenting is going well</a> because she and Tarek are all about “putting the kids first.”</p><p class=p1>“The rest of the stuff is trivial, but ultimately we all just love the children and want them to be happy, thriving individuals,” she said. “It’s really all that matters.”</p><p class=p1>Christina and Josh are balancing family life and their relationships with new projects on <i>Christina on the Coast</i>, their HGTV design show based in Orange County, California. Christina and her husband also split time in rural Tennessee, which is where they film HGTV spinoff <i>Christina in the Country.</i></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I really wanted big projects,” she teased to <i>Us </i>of the fifth season of Christina on the Coast. “When the show first started, it was only 30 minutes [and] we only had time to do, like, two spaces. And then, they added more family components, and then we had time to do a little bit more. Right now the network’s wanting a little bit less of family and more of the project. So in that case, I really wanted to do big projects and luckily we got some really big ones —entire homes down to the studs. [We are] really touching the entire part of these houses; long remodels that took, like, a year. I think fans are really gonna like seeing an entire project come together.”</p><p class=p1><i>Christina on the Coast </i>season 5 premieres on HGTV and Max on Thursday, July 11, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Andrea Simpson</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewLW1zZpkoZmcoXqiusNmnLFlpJa%2FpreMnqNmpZ%2BqwLStjJqpnmWRqXqiedGemKWkqWK0sLvDZqqpp6Rk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./do-the-kelce-brothers-have-the-same-parents.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Do the Kelce brothers have the same parents?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./big-jay-oakerson-bio-age-wife-net-worth-daughter-weight-loss-and-comedy-3.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Big Jay Oakerson Bio, Age, Wife, Net Worth, Daughter, Weight Loss and Comedy</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
