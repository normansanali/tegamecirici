Kevin and Devon met up in Los Angeles after their unexpected encounter in Paris, where they formally decided to give their romance another shot. “We deserve a shot,” Devon said, cueing happy tears from her beau. “I missed you,” Kevin said. “And now I don’t have to miss you anymore.”</p><p>It is likely that Devon will be a staple castaway in the show,</p><p>Besides being romantically linked, Devon and Kevin also collaborated professionally. She wrote a music video titled Talk About, where Kevin and Devon portrayed the roles of husband and wife. In 2016, Kevin posted a Facebook status writing, “My latest work as a lead actor in the short-music video #greendragon (for Martin Scorsese’s film, Revenge of the Green Dragons, which debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).) by Devon Diep is out!! Check out this sexy, artistic, and exciting project!” The video is currently <a href=#>unavailable</a>.</p><p>In May 2022, <a href=#>a Redditor</a> took to the platform to share about a certain encounter that involved the couple. The person saw Kevin at an event celebrating Asian/Pacific Islander Heritage month and wanted to take pictures with him. According to Redditor, they didn’t approach him because he was all over with a performer and confirmed it was singer Devon Diep.</p><p>They wrote, “I thought it was a little strange because they were really affectionate with each other in that public setting. Not like people in their late 30s/early 40s who have been in a relationship for over 5 years, but like people much younger who just started dating.”</p><p>In March 2022, both Devon and Kevin attended <a href=#>GRIOT Gala Oscars After Party</a>, which was celebrating diversity and inclusion in the industry.</p><p>So, yes, they were likely an ex and might’ve gotten back together again, whether it was for the show or in real life.</p><h3><strong>Devon Diep Age</strong></h3><p>Devon Diep was reportedly born in 1980.
