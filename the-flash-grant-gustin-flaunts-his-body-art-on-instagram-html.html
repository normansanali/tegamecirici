Likewise, some of the stars of the show find creative ways to express themselves in the real world. One The Flash star, in particular, <a href=#>Grant Gustin</a>, uses body art as one way to set himself apart. Here are a few of the actor’s Instagram snaps of his tattoos, plus what he says about them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Grant-Gustin-at-Comic-Con.jpg><h2><strong>Grant Gustin’s tattoos reflect his experiences</strong></h2><p id=par-2_65>“I’ve got a Virginia tattoo right here. It’s where I’m from,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Gustin told Young Hollywood</a> in an interview during Comic-Con. The star was referring to a tattoo positioned on his left upper torso, as seen in several <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Instagram photos</a>. But, it appears that Gustin’s home state is not the only subject close to his heart. He has inked other symbols that mirror his personal life.</p><h2><strong>Gustin’s love and passion</strong></h2><figure class="rt-ig-embed wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-3_81>Gustin tied the knot with <a href=#>LA Thoma Gustin</a> in December of 2018, but the couple went a step further than traditional wedding rings to symbolize their union. The twosome doubled down with coordinating tattoos, which Gustin <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>shared an image</a> of on Instagram. Gustin sports the letters “LA” on his arm, while his wife’s arm is adorned with a “G.” As a finishing touch, the initials are pierced with a tattooed arrow that begins on one arm and ends on the other.</p><p id=par-4_57>In the same Instagram post, the actor shared more body art featuring a symbol for The Flash character and the text “Love [above] all else.” In the image caption, Gustin wrote: “LA and I got the coolest tattoos from the legend, [Mr. K]. He also added this little [The Flash symbol]. I can’t wait for our next session! Gonna be insane…”</p><h2><strong>Superhero fan art</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-5_23>&nbsp;“Superman…I love him,” reads the inscription in his mother’s handwriting on Gustin’s left forearm. In a video from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>DC All Access</a>, Gustin explained:</p><p>When I was a kid, I was a huge Superman fan. And also really into drawing and coloring. And I was like four or five, and so my mom used to draw him for me, Superman, and I would color that in. So that’s why it’s her handwriting. And this was also a line in my first professional job.</p>Grant Gustin on DC All Access<h2><strong>Honoring man’s best friend</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-6_48>Gustin is not shy about sharing his adoration for his pets on social media. His collection of cute dog pictures is enough to give any animal lover a case of the warm and fuzzies. Now, the entertainer has a portrait of his beloved pooch, Jett, on his arm.</p><p id=par-7_57>He <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>shared a snapshot</a> of the tattoo and added a caption that read, “This one is special. I have been wanting a portrait of my best bud, Jett, for a long while now. We’ve been through a lot together, and now he can be with me always. Thank you for this perfect piece,&nbsp;Doctor Woo. You’re a legend.”</p><h2><strong>Grant Gustin</strong>, b<strong>ody art aficionado</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-5></figure><p id=par-8_43>Aside from the tattoos celebrating his love and family, Gustin sports other marks, including a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">skull on his forearm</a> and the word, “gold” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">on his shoulder blade</a>. The star beautifully expresses his individuality through the original masterpieces he displays on his body.</p><p id=par-9_14><a href=#>Read more –<strong> ‘The Flash’: Who is Grant Gustin’s Wife, Dr. LA Thoma Gustin?</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMn6Oaq5hitLOtza1koK2jqbavecWlmK6mpKh6qbXSZpmonKlirrPAjKilZqGeqMGis9GapGegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-does-it-cost-to-put-up-a-morton-building-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How much does it cost to put up a Morton building?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fuller-house.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fuller House (TV) Cast - All Actors and Actresses</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
