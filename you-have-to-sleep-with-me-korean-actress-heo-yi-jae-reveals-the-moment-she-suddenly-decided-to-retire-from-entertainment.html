She said that their relationship started off friendly, but that he started to curse at her on set every day, possibly due to her not contacting him when they weren’t on set.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>One day on set when the actor had cursed at her again, the director spoke to Heo about the two actors’ relationship. The director told Heo, “He [the actor] is looking at you sexually, but you didn’t, so it seems he tried to knock you down with fear,” referring to the actor cursing at Heo constantly.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Shocked, Heo went to the actor’s waiting room to speak to him about the situation. The actor allegedly said to Heo, “Yi-jae, do you know what people say after watching our drama? They say you and I don’t seem to have a relationship.” Heo says she apologized to the actor and told him that she would try harder in their scenes together so that they wouldn’t be criticized.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>However, the unnamed actor reportedly continued, saying, “But do you know how to make it seem like we’re a couple?” She responded saying she didn’t know, and he said, “We have to sleep together.”&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p dir=ltr lang=en>Retired actress Heo Yijae talks about male actor who sexually harassed her + senior actors’ power trip <a href=# rel=noopener>pic.twitter.com/d5GUJhvcVe</a></p><p>— Not Pannchoa (@notpannchoa) <a href=# rel=noopener>September 10, 2021</a></p><p><b>The hunt: </b><span>After the video — which has over 500,00 views as of this writing — was posted, many began trying to figure out who the actor that made the advance was in the comment section of Way’s video.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Advertisement</p><ul><li><span>Because Heo described the actor as very popular and a “king on set,” many viewers were left curious as to who he was.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Heo revealed his identity to Way in a clip that wasn’t shared with the audience.
