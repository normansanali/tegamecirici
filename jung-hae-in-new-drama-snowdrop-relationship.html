They mentioned:</span></p><p><span><strong>"As we have gathered a team of actors who have both top class acting skills and visuals, we will greet our viewers with an especially high-quality drama."</strong></span></p><p><span>'Snowdrop' is brought by the pack of directors and writers JTBC's hit production 'Sky Castle.' The upcoming drama will surround the love story of a student of a prestigious university, Im Soo Ho, who unexpectedly rushes to a female dorm room with a pool of blood in his body. Also, it walks on the storyline of Eun Young Cho, who hides Im Soo Ho and takes care of his wounds even during the issues of close surveillance.</span></p><p><span><strong>Read More:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Squid Game Star Jung Ho Yeon Is Dating Boyfriend Lee Dong-hwi| Explore Her Bio & Net Worth</a></strong></span></p><p><span>Im Soo Ho is a German-born gentle charm, and he falls in love with Eun Young Cho.</span></p><p><span>Jung Hae In portrays the role of Im Soo Ho while Jisoo plays Eun Young Cho.

They have led a subtle profile regarding their dating life and make a scarce public outing.</span></p><p><span>They were spotted leaving Hae In's fan meeting in Seoul back in March 2019. Not much information regarding their love life is known.</span></p><p><span><strong>See This:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Is Alex Rodriguez Dating Kelly Bensimon?

The rumor that started from inside the drama later turned out to be public. The alleged lovebirds portrayed the on-screen romances in the drama.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Back in May 2018, Son Ye-jin stated in an interview that she gets a question that cites, 'You're dating right?' but does not gets 'Are you dating?' which seems a kind of judgemental. When asked about her possible tie with Jung Hae In, she preferred the interviewer to ask Jung Hae himself. And he had something to say about their bond for the denial of the burning rumors.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/celebs/jung-hae-in-son-ye-jin.jpg alt="jung hae in son ye jin" width=650 height=361 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Jung Hae In and Son Ye-jin (©: Channel Korea)</strong></p><p><span>He said, '<strong>People around me keep saying, 'Why don't you two date?' and 'If you two date, I'll support you.'

In spite of that, I tried to act with sincerity in every moment, and [the reactions we received] made me think that my sincerity had been successfully conveyed to some degree."</strong></span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Jung freely accepted that they grew closer while filming the drama; however, they did not take their friendship to a romantic level.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46jrKefXZ2upnnIp2SnnadisbOtzJpkrKafrLGzu89mqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCp</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./liza-soberano.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Liza Soberano</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./684902-jayson-tatum-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jayson Tatum Net Worth 2023: What Is The NBA Star Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
