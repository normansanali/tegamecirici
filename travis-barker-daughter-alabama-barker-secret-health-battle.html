"I would love to see you guys getting random pictures of you taken of you when you're leaving the grocery store, in the middle of a sentence, with your mouth wide open… and let's see how beautiful you look."&nbsp;</p><p id=ev2TQgyyDu data-wc=65>Asking to be shown some compassion, Alabama admitted that her recent health struggles have resulted in her gaining "5-10 pounds". <strong>"I also have a thyroid problem and an autoimmune disease. So that's one of the main reasons why I've weight gained,"&nbsp;</strong>she explained. "So it would be very appreciated if you guys just kept your opinions to yourself, it would get you further in life."&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=ehTY4l2IfPQ data-wc=42>However, Alabama expects she will return to her "normal" weight once her health is "balanced".

Weight fluctuates and I don't want any girls that are young watching this that are gaining weight to ever think there's something wrong with it.&nbsp;</p><p id=ePfp6-VbeBp data-wc=41>"There is a certain point where if your health is getting affected by it then you need to change it, but no.
