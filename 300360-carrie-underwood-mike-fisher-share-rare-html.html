Underwood spoke to God, noting how the divine timing wasn't right, and figured they find a way through it.</p><p class=Fg>In the spring, she was pregnant again but had another miscarriage. In early 2018, the star was pregnant for the third time but had her third miscarriage, and at that point, she was pretty frustrated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/cfef71c8ab77f3993c8bd9ab436f7478.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Carrie Underwood during the American Music Awards on October 9, 2018, in Los Angeles, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>The songstress was writing music as she experienced her losses, and right after finding out she was going to have a miscarriage, she had a writing session. Her album, "Cry Pretty," had a title song where she spoke about her grief, noting how falling apart was human.</p><p class=Fg>The musician noted how one couldn't hide or fight the truth. Underwood <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/carrie-underwood-on-getting-beyond-three-miscarriages-to-joy/>explained</a> how she'd always been afraid of getting angry because they were so blessed and had Isaiah, the "sweetest" and "best" thing.</p><p class=Fg>Mike's wife tried to convince herself that it was okay if they couldn't have other children because their son was amazing. She also cherished their life and didn't feel she had much to complain about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/d91c0a70585ef50f12eb6a32850e2719.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Carrie Underwood accepts the Favorite Female Artist - Country award during the American Music Awards on October 9, 2018, in Los Angeles, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg><a class="Xd a" href=#>Underwood</a> didn't believe she had anything to be angry about because her husband, friends, job, and child were all incredible, but she eventually got mad. However, Mike felt they would have a son named Jacob, and one night things changed.</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>The Night When Carrie Turned to God</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>The songstress ended up having conversations with God about her frustrations. One day, her husband came to her and told her they would have another baby boy named Jacob.</p><p class=Fg>Mike explained how he'd come to that conclusion after having two miscarriages and contemplating adoption. While <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.iamsecond.com/film/mike-and-carrie/#series-video-421721503>wrestling with his thoughts</a>, the former athlete "sensed" God telling him they would have a son named Jacob.</p><p class=Fg>However, they had their third miscarriage, and Underwood was so frustrated that she confronted her husband, demanding to know where their second son was. Mike doubted what he'd heard from God, but they got pregnant for the fourth time.</p><p class=Fg>One night, the singer told her husband she thought she'd lost that baby too, but he suggested they visit a doctor to confirm.

She recalled <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/carrie-underwood-on-getting-beyond-three-miscarriages-to-joy/>saying</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"And I was like, 'You heard me.' Not that He hasn't in the past. But maybe, I don't know, He heard me."</p><p class=Fg>She asked to see her doctor so they could conclude the pregnancy and move on; however, a nurse told her things were looking great with her fourth pregnancy!

She <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs_U3ooAyrJ/>said</a> their hearts were full, but their eyes were tired, adding:</p><p class=Fg>"Our lives are forever changed.
