You’re pulling our leg.” The reporter then showed them the family tree graph that connects Hanks to Mister Rogers. Based on the graph, the two are sixth cousins related through a shared ancestor named Johannes Meffert.</p><p>The graph showed that Johannes Meffert’s two sons, Jacob Mefford and William Mefford, led to the subsequent bloodlines that produced Hanks and Mister Rogers, respectively.
