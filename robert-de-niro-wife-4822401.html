He has starred in some of the most iconic films, including <strong>Martin Scorsese’s</strong>&nbsp;1973 film Mean Streets and 1990’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Goodfellas</a>, and has two Oscars to his name, plus four Emmy nominations. He didn’t achieve such great success on his own, though, as he has had two wives supporting him through it all over the years.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Robert has only been married twice but has had two high-profile romances outside of marriage. He was involved with model <strong>Toukie Smith</strong>, with whom he had two children. In the 2020s, he started dating<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Tiffany Chen</strong></a>. The couple welcomed<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> their first child in May 2023</a>. This would be <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Robert’s seventh child overall</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Learn about Robert’s former wives, <strong>Diahnne Abbott </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Grace Hightower</strong>.</p><h2><strong>Diahnne Abbott</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Robert-De-Niro-Diahnne-Abbott-everett-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Diahnne is an actress and singer born in New York City on Jan. 1, 1945. She had a solid resume of roles in the 1970s and the 1980s, including in Taxi Driver, in which Robert starred (that’s also where they met!). However, she slowed down her career in the late ’80s and only has six credits on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a> in the 2000s. She is most recognized as Robert’s first wife, having married him in 1976.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While her career was thriving, she welcomed a son with Robert, <strong>Raphael De Niro</strong>, who was born on Nov. 9, 1976. Although she only has one biological kid with Robert, Diahnne had a daughter, <strong>Drena</strong>, from a previous relationship, whom Robert adopted after they married. Drena is an actress herself and has appeared in several films alongside her super-successful father, such as 1997’s Wag the Dog, 2002’s City by the Sea, and 2018’s The Intern. Diannhe and Robert’s union lasted until 1988.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>While there is not much known about Diahnne and Robert’s relationship, he once told people to not have kids with someone if they’re going to end up divorced. “The only thing I would say is that if you get married, it’s easier probably not to have children if you’re going to split up — it makes life simpler,” he told the Belfast Telegraph in 2014 (via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Huffpost</a>). If it were only that simple!</p><h2><strong>Grace Hightower</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/robert-de-niro-grace-hightower-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Grace is an actress, entrepreneur, and philanthropist born in Mississippi on April 7, 1955. While she does have a few acting credits on her IMDb page, she seems most moved by her business, Grace Hightower & Coffees, the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a> which claims to work with the people of Rwanda and strive for a better future. “Founder and CEO, Grace Hightower De Niro was motivated and inspired by the Rwandan people’s courageous spirit to succeed,” the website reads. “These individuals inspired us to bring you a collection of coffees that highlight the extraordinary flavor characteristics found within Rwanda. Their coffees represent the promise of a better future, one that harnesses the inner strength of the Rwandan people and the fertility of the land on which they live.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The Cape Fear actor and Grace walked down the aisle in 1997, nearly a decade after meeting in London at a nightclub. They welcomed their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first child together</a>, son <strong>Elliot</strong>, in March 1998. Unfortunately, though, Robert filed for divorce a year later. “Bobby was just not working hard enough at his marriage to Grace,” a friend of Robert’s told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People </a>at the time. An intense custody battle ensued, but the pair were able to reconcile and even renewed their vows in 2004. Things between the couple appeared to be going well, and in 2011, Grace and Robert surprised fans when they welcomed their second child together via surrogate: a girl named <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Helen</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Unfortunately, seven years later, their happy world crumbled, and Robert confirmed that he and Grace were getting divorced. “Grace and I have two beautiful children together. We are entering a period of transition in our relationship, which is a difficult but constructive process,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People </a>in a statement in Nov. 2018. “I honor Grace as a wonderful mother and ask for privacy and respect from all as we proceed to develop our roles as partners in parenting.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Unfortunately, the divorce turned quite bitter, and Grace was accused of demanding that her credit card limit, which is attached to the Raging Bull actor’s bank account, remain at $100,000 per month after Robert cut it in half when he faced financial troubles during the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>coronavirus pandemic</a>, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>. Furthermore, Robert’s lawyer, <strong>Caroline Krauss</strong>, said he cannot retire due to his financial stress and obligations. “These people, in spite of his robust earnings, have always spent more than he has earned, so this 76-year-old robust man couldn’t retire even if he wanted to because he can’t afford to keep up with his lifestyle expense,” she said to a judge in 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9GomZ6qpGKxpnnNoqmoZaees6Z5k3Fpa2xgZnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./take-me-im-yours-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Johnny Gill Take Me (I'm Yours) l</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-the-meaning-behind-triple-h.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is the meaning behind Triple H?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
