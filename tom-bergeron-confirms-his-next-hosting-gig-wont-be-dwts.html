I am returning to hosting — that is the part I hope doesn’t disappoint some of you,” Bergeron, 65, revealed in a <a href=#>video</a> shared via Twitter on Friday, April 23. “It’s not going to be a show that I previously hosted, however, it’s very reminiscent of a show I previously hosted.”</p><p><a href=#>The Masked Singer</a> alum hosted the ABC ballroom dance competition from its 2005 premiere until July 2020, when he announced that he had been let go from the series after 28 seasons.

I mean, you know, Tom Bergeron and Erin. They lead the show, this is one of the top-rated shows in the world,” she told Us exclusively in September 2020. “So [I’m] respecting the stage that they have set and then adding my icing to that. I feel confident about that, but of course, it’s a challenge, but I don’t back away from challenges.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuopV2XsrOzxKump2WTpLuntdGmqmagmah6r7HXrWShp6Optq%2BzjKCgoGWnpLu1ecGeZJ2vpKh8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-watch-fast-and-furious-movies-tv-shows-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where to Watch Every Fast &amp;amp; Furious Thing Right Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shay-mooney-shows-off-his-impressive-body-transformation-in-new-instagram-selfie-529975-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shay Mooney Shows Off His Impressive Body Transformation in New Instagram Selfie</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
