Rose was known for his aggressive game and elite talent and ultimately met with great success during his career. Among them, a three-time World Series winner, a three-time National League batting champion, and a 17-time all-star. He also has the most career hits of any player in Major League Baseball. Despite his extremely successful career, Rose's later life was marred by scandal and bankruptcy after years of compulsive gambling.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Rise of a Baseball Icon</h2><p>Pete Rose made his Major League debut on April 8, 1963, with the Cincinnati Reds. Rose spent 24 years in the league, playing for the Reds, the Philadelphia Phillies, and the Montreal Expos. His endless motor and love for the game birthed his nickname, Charlie Hustle. With a hard-nosed style of play and an ability to hit for amazing consistency, he was one of the most beloved and iconic figures the game has ever seen.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Low Point: Pete Rose</h2><p>Rose's on-field successes were overshadowed by his actions off the field, most notably his gambling. Rose was accused in the late 1980s of betting on his team, the Cincinnati Reds, which is an MLB no-no. This led to a high-profile investigation concerning Rose's gambling on the sport, in which it was revealed he had bet on MLB games, including those of his team; in 1989, he was given a lifetime ban from baseball, which stands to this day.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Bankruptcy and the Economic Mess</h2><p>He began to experience the ramifications of his gambling as his budget quickly went south. The reports included news of a $400,000 debt that Rose owed a bookmaker in New York City over three months in 1987. The same risk-hungry nature of his on-high bets resulted in huge losses, and quite soon he ended up in significant financial trouble. Though Rose was previously a well-paid professional baseball player and had a lucrative contract to serve as the Reds manager, his financial issues pushed him into declaring bankruptcy, painting a very different picture than his on-field accomplishments.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Aftermath</h2><p>After&nbsp;being banned from baseball, things went tragically bad for Pete after his baseball career. Although he tried to rebuild his image on and off the felt, the consequences of his gambling problem lingered. The downhill trajectory of Pete Rose is a lesson for us all: gambling is a powerful dragon that not only can turn you into the enemy of the people but can destroy the best — and most lucrative — professional life any of God's creatures can have.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>In the End</h2><p>While his on-field baseball exploits were undeniably impressive, they stood in stark contrast to the challenges he faced outside of the game. The Pete Rose story reminds us of the need for careful financial planning as well as the danger of gambling addiction — a fact of life for the exceptionally gifted and successful, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0mikpZpfnby4ecOim2afkaKvrbXNoGSlnZGZerGx055kq6ejmnq1u4ybmKejoqq9ta%2FY</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-wizarding-world-down-how-to-check.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Wizarding World down?
