The Two Pair chapter is sure to provide an exciting follow-up to these events.</p><p>With only a few chapters left in the series, it’s hard to say where things will ultimately end up. However, it seems that Nagi has finally found her new goal, and Kaiser is determined to step out of Noel Noa’s shadow.
