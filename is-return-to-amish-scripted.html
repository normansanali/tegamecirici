But fast-forward to the present day, and TLC's network has begun airing shows like Breaking Amish and Return to Amish, which intend to offer viewers a look into their unique culture. Many critics have felt that these shows don't actually reflect Amish reality, however, which has led many to wonder if the Return To Amish series is scripted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is the TLC series 'Return to Amish' scripted?</h2><p>In 2016, Kate Stolz, who appeared in the early seasons of Breaking Amish and Return to Amish, criticized the reality show in a series of tweets. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Weekly</a>, she wanted the show's fans to ask her questions so they could be better informed. In the since-deleted tweets, she wrote, "Doing a reality show was one of the worst decisions I made in my life. Everything on the show is so edited and out of context."</p><p>The model and fashion designer also tweeted at a journalist who she felt mistook why she had been crying in a promo. In that tweet, she declared, "I was upset because the producers keep us in a room for hours and ask the same questions over and over — they're relentless. If we don’t give them the answer they want, they keep us in there until we cry or give them the answer they want.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kate chose to leave Return to Amish after Season 3.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Two years later, Kate was interviewed by<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> In Touch</a>. When asked whether or not the Amish series was scripted, she told the outlet, "I really can't [say]. I'm sorry," and added that she was not in touch of any of her former cast members. While it’s not clear to what degree Return to Amish is scripted, it does seem that whether or not viewers believe in the reality of the series, they still enjoy watching the show. &nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Return to Amish is so fake.
