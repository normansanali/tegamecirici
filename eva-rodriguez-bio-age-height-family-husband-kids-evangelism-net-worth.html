She, therefore, attended a Xhosa Mvumakufa training course in the Eastern Cape where she was one of the first women to undergo a Sangoma ceremony in Mdantsane, near East London.</p><p>She is also currently writing a book about the experience and culture of native Americans as well as African traditional healing.</p><p>The 2012 Sundance Film Festival hosted the premiere of Searching for Sugar Man, from Swedish director Malik Bendjelloul, detailing the efforts by two fans to see if Rodriguez was still alive. Like her father, Eva is always ready for a challenge.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=eva-rodriguez-evangelic-battle></span><span>Eva Rodriguez Evangelic Battle</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eva Rodriguez was serving as a church’s companion pastor for extra than three years when the senior pastor suffered a moral failure that disqualified him from leadership. Even though she sensed the Holy Spirit’s urging to step into the senior role, many inside the congregation refused to aid her because of her gender.</p><p>The warfare wrenched her heart. She persisted to seek steering from the Lord. With that, she planted&nbsp;Centro Cristiano De Adoración(Christian Worship middle) in a member’s living room in Sacramento, California.</p><p>From the Spanish-language church’s first collecting of 18 adults and kids in 2006, today the church is prospering below its new call, Cántico Nuevo (New tune). Eva Rodriguez as its senior pastor.</p><p>The couple continues a high countrywide profile. In 2008 Eva’s prayer opened the Republican national conference; Samuel’s prayer opened the conference in 2012. Samuel regularly appears on Fox news.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=eva-rodriguez-book></span><span><strong>Eva Rodriguez Book</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The healing and gentler side of life thus began, when she sat down to write the book The Circle of Love. Although not strictly a children’s book it encourages children to enjoy a spiritual awareness of nature.</p><p>It took a decade to complete the book, and for it to become a school project. The Circle of Love was adapted by UNIMA as an art intervention project for over 300 children at the Good Hope Seminary Junior School, in Cape Town.</p><p>For eight weeks, with the help of many volunteers and donors, the children participated in drama, drumming, singing, puppetry, poetry, dance, wardrobe, design, and art. In May 2009 it was performed at the George Society of the Arts Theatre, during the Amateur Arts Festival.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-eva-rodriguez></span><span>Who is Eva Rodriguez?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eva Rodriguez is an American former combat helicopter pilot turned author, spiritual healer, and activist.
