What's important is that BitFenix makes the most of the Outlaw's relatively small real estate (at least, small for a full ATX case).</p><p>Slotting the motherboard in was easy enough, though I'm finding the I/O shield for our testbed has seen better days. BitFenix has a couple of motherboard standoffs already installed. Our CPU cooler doesn't quite line up with the 120mm exhaust fan, though I'm not sure I know of any that would; the fan's placement is a bit low. The mounting holes surrounding the board are remarkably small but surprisingly good for keeping cable clutter contained.</p><p align=center><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/5224/drivemounts.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Since the case is inexpensive, the "tool-less" drive installation really just boils down to thumbscrews. BitFenix includes thumbscrews designed for the smaller threading of optical drives as well as larger ones designed to fit into the rubber-grommeted bottom two hard drive bays (they'll also fit in the top bays). Our Blu-ray drive is on the long side and does overlap the side-mounted SATA ports a little, though, and the hard drive encroaches a bit over the bottom fan mount.</p><p>Honestly I'm not a big fan of bottom fan mounts anyhow; with rare exception (SilverStone's rotated enclosure designs like the FT02) I don't see these getting any use as most cases just aren't designed to sit high enough off of the floor (usually carpet). Compounding that is the fact that they're usually not far enough from the power supply; our 180mm power supply actually encroaches enough on the mount to prevent you from putting a fan there, and 180mm isn't an unusual or excessive length for a power supply. But I digress; installing the drives was easy enough to do, although the 2.5" SSD needs to be mounted to the bottom of the case as it has no "bay" of its own (or you'll want to buy a 2.5" to 3.5" adapter sled). Not a big deal, but it warrants mentioning.</p><p align=center><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/5224/internals.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Expansion cards require popping out the slot covers cut from the frame of the Outlaw. The steel used here is especially thin and fragile, pointing to a place where costs are liable to have been cut in manufacture. Sometimes that's not all bad, though; twisting the slot covers out was a lot easier than it usually is. Finally, sliding the power supply in was also pretty easy.</p><p align=center><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/5224/cabling.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Wiring things up was a little bit trickier, though, and part of that is just due to the nature of a small case. Surprisingly, where Rosewill fouled things up with the Ranger, BitFenix gets the cable organization right; mostly it's just a matter of threading everything through the mounting holes in the motherboard tray. Having a modular power supply certainly helped (although AUX 12V clearance is at an all time low), but if you're spending $50 on a case chances are you're not up for splurging on modular kit either.</p><p>I'm mostly happy with the Outlaw's assembly. The interior winds up being impressively clean given the circumstances, as you can actually use the mounting holes under the hard drive cage to keep power cables pinned into place. There are certainly easier enclosures to build in, but very few of them are this inexpensive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIJzfpNomaKslpq7qsSMqKytpJGseri0xKdkoqaVrb2mutKirZ5llKSytLrTZqSemZ5isKmxwKlmbA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrity-prison-stories.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Celebrity Prison Stories</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-was-in-vance-john-rodriguezs-family-705251-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who was in Vance John Rodriguezs Family?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
