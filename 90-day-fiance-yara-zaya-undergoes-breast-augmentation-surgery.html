Although they frequently bickered, they’ve proven that they’re made for each other.</p><p>The good-looking couple has been traveling lately, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yara tackling business endeavors in Los Angeles</a>, California. As it turns out, she was also tackling some personal business while in Beverly Hills — namely cosmetic surgery.</p><p>Over the weekend, Yara took some time away from work to host a Q&A session with her 588,000 Instagram followers that she titled, “Let’s talk a little bit?”</p><p>While fielding a variety of questions, Yara came across one fan who left a comment that read, “It makes me so mad people talking bad about you when you announced your surgery.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>90 Day Fiance star Yara Zaya undergoes breast augmentation</h2><p>Yara responded, “You know guys, no matter what I do I get judged so often. And I breastfed my child for 17 months. If not that, I wouldn’t do it, but I did it and I’m happy that I did it. And if I will care [what] everybody think about me, I will get friggin’ crazy.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The next question submitted by a fan asked, “What kind of work are you having done by Angela’s Dr?”</p><p>Along with tagging plastic surgeon Dr. Michael K. Obeng — the same surgeon who performed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Angela Deem’s plastic surgery</a> — Yara thanked him, telling him, “I feel confident again,” before explaining what work she recently had done.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Yara-Zayas-IG-Story-slides-2-1.jpg><p>“I get like a breast lift and implants because as you know guys, I breastfeed for 17 months straight. No water, no formula, nothing… so I was really needing help. And plus I had an anatomic issue, so I love it,” Yara explained.</p><p>Yara continued to explain that when she breastfed her and Jovi’s 1-year-old daughter Mylah as a newborn, she required feedings every 30 minutes, which Yara claimed attributed to her sagging breasts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Yara-Zayas-IG-Story-slides-1-2.jpg><p>In another slide, Yara answered a fan who asked whether she’ll be able to breastfeed future children with her new implants. Yara answered, “Yes, you can. For me it was very important. My friends breastfed with implants. So yes it’s okay you can do it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Yara urges others considering plastic surgery to ignore the naysayers</h2><p>Dr. Obeng shared a video interview with Yara on his Instagram, following her surgery. The Boujee by Yara founder urged others considering going through with a similar surgery to do their research and go for it, regardless of any backlash they may receive.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>“Don’t care what any other people say. Choose a good doctor who will do a good job for you and enjoy yourself,” Yara said in the video.</p><p>This isn’t the first <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">plastic surgery transformation</a> that Yara has undergone. During the 90 Day Fiance Season 8 Tell All, Yara admitted to a nose job and lip fillers, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">telling viewers</a>, “I don’t see nothing wrong with that. If somebody don’t like something on themselves, change it. Yes, you need to love yourself the way you are. But if you can’t accept something, it’s OK to change it.”</p><p>90 Day Fiance airs on Sundays at 8/7c on TLC and Discovery+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ2lleqWt2GadopmemLJuxcCrmGayka6ubsHNnZyrn5%2BawG6u0Z6YrKxdlsKoucSnq5qsmaS7br%2FUq56eqqlk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./can-you-play-mlb-the-show-23-early.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Can You Play 'MLB The Show 23' Early?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./antarctic-exploration-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>100-Year Old Photos Reveal The Dark Side Of Antarctic Exploration</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
