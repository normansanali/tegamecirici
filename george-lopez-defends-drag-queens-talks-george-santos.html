I love drag queens, I’m a drag hag, we were at a drag show this last weekend, I’m constantly defending drag queens. This has nothing to do with drag queens, this has to do with hypocrisy,” Navarro said.</p><p>“[Santos], when he was running, went on Facebook and expressed support for the Florida law, the one we refer to as ‘Don’t Say Gay,’ he’s aligned himself with a party that has turned drag queens into a cultural wedge issue — a manufactured cultural wedge issue — so, it’s endless lies,” she went on.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Actor George Lopez chatted with the ladies of “The View” about drag queens. <span class=credit>ABC/The View</span></figure><p>Lopez is no stranger to the small screen.
