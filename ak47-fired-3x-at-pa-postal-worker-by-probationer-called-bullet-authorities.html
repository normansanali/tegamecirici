You have my mail!,” according to a criminal complaint obtained by<strong><a href=#> WTAE</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The man was later identified at Martinel "Bullet" Lee Humphries, 28, who was spot on a "homeowner's private camera footage shows the suspect had exited the running vehicle, clearly carrying a gun, and headed toward Woods Run Ave through a wooded area," Pittsburgh Public Safety detailed in a release.</p><p>"The male postal worker was not injured, but he told police he dove for cover as the actor fired at least three shots at him from a vehicle. One residence sustained damage from the gunfire," as stated in the release.</p><p>The AK47 and three shell casings were recovered at the scene.&nbsp;The suspect's vehicle, a blue Subaru Legacy, was located in the 3900 block of Oakdale Street and Bullet was found walking&nbsp;in the 900 block of Woods Run, shortly after, authorities detail in the release.&nbsp;</p><p>He was charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault, discharging a firearm into an occupied structure, recklessly endangering another person, firearms violations, and providing false identification to law enforcement.</p><p>He has been held in Allegheny County Jail after being denied by Judge&nbsp;Jehosha Wright, for the same reason he denied an Erie man who held restaurant workers in Pittsburgh hostage that evening, "to assure community safety." You can read more about that case here.&nbsp;</p><p>Bullet's vehicle was towed to be processed for additional evidence.</p><p>The investigation is active and ongoing.</p><p>Bullet has a lengthy record and was on probation for 2020 assault conviction at the time of this incident, court records show.
