He had appeared on many popular movies and TV shows, starting with the 1978 Battlestar Galactica movie and the TV series of the same name, in which he played Boxey. As a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>child star</a>, he then moved on to appearances on Mork & Mindy, Eight Is Enough, Laverne & Shirley, and CHiPs, to name a few series. But, Hathaway's biggest role came in 1984 when he starred as the warrior <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Atreyu in The NeverEnding Story</a>. The fantasy movie became a classic, and to this day, Hathaway celebrates the role through appearances at fan conventions and by posting fantatics' NeverEnding Story tattoos on his Instagram. Read on to learn more about his life since the movie came out.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See Young Jenny From Forrest Gump Now at 37</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/noah-1980.jpg><p>Hathaway kept acting frequently in the couple of years that followed The NeverEnding Story. He was in episodes of few TV shows, including Family Ties, and he starred in the 1986 horror movie Troll. But, after 1986, he stopped acting, and didn't return until 1994 with the movie To Die, to Sleep. He then took another break from acting and returned to onscreen roles in 2012 with Sushi Girl, taking on a few more projects in the years that followed. His most recent movie is the 2016 horror film The Chair, and, on his Instagram, he has been <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>sharing posts about filming</a> a new project.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/atreyu.png><p>In a 2012 interview with the Australian show Mornings, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Hathaway shared</a> that he and his ex-wife had opened a tattoo shop in Amsterdam and that he was still tattooing clients. He also spoke to TooFab about <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>his tattooing experiences</a> in 2016 and said that he had seen a lot of people with tattoos of Auryn, the medallion Atreyu wears in The NeverEnding Story, including someone who had his entire back covered with the image. TooFab also reported that Hathaway had spent some time working as a bartender, and his Instagram bio notes that he is an "NRA certified Pistol Instructor."<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p class=p1><strong>For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/noah-2020.jpg><p>Hathaway is married to <strong>Kayla Hathaway</strong>, and he often posts pictures of them together on his Instagram.
