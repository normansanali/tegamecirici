However, it was eventually revealed that after being beaten up by Zach, leaving him with a broken leg and arm, it was actually Alex who killed Bryce by throwing him into the water at the docks, after realising just how much damage he had caused.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/336228c462fe-13rw-6-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=epFP7QclCDge data-wc=7><strong>It is revealed that Alex killed Bryce</strong></p><p id=e3iWgGAxE0pK data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Viewers said the same thing about Sanditon's first episode</a></strong></p><p id=e5EKDS_BS7QI data-wc=147>Speaking to about the revelation, Bryce actor Justin Prentice said: "You know, I could see why when I read it was Alex. I was like, 'Yeah, I get it'. I didn't necessarily call this one. I knew it wasn't Zach, so I knew that there was more to the story than that and I always assumed that Jess might be involved. So I had parts of the puzzle sort of mapped out, but not the whole picture. So that was a fun little surprise." He continued: "I've gotten to explore the villain side of Bryce for many years now. And that's been, as an actor, very rewarding — playing something different from how I am. But then to take a character that you're so used to playing one way and start throwing in elements of the complete opposite, seeing humanity breaking through was very enjoyable."</p><p id=eZZBbEVCt0K8 data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>A timeline of everything that’s happened on Peaky Blinders so far</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
