The two launched <a href=#>Just Add X</a> — premium non-alcoholic mixers that allow consumers to choose their own spirit.</p><p>Their business partner, creative director <strong>James Kirtley</strong> explained to Us Weekly how the name Just Add X came to be. “It’s an acronym for Jax of course — Just Add X — and the X stands for whatever spirit you want to add.”</p><p>Bass, 41, loved the idea to create their own line of mixers after growing tired of ordering cranberry juice on nights out, and the trio wanted to cater to millennials who prefer to be their own mixologists at home. “We learned that the millennials out there, they’re not drinking as much and they’d rather drink at home and be their own mixologist,” the singer explained. “So we wanted to put the mixologist in their hands but make it very, very simple and easy.”</p><p>The “Daily Popcast With Lance Bass” podcast host tells Us they focused on the simplicity of cocktail making, playing off of Taylor’s lackluster bartending skills. “I thought it was so funny because of course the inspiration came from Jax being such a horrible bartender.”</p><p>The Bravo star, 40, mirrored the sentiment, telling Us, “The mixers are so easy to use — inspired by my lack of bartending skills as many of you know — and taste incredible. Brittany and I have been playing around with different cocktails and we also drink them by the pool on its own.”</p><p>Kirtley focused on creating a healthy alternative to everyday mixers, explaining to Us, “We started adding vitamin B-12 and vitamin C to the various mixers, just depending on whatever fruit was in there. We use pure cane sugar as the natural sweetener and it’s all natural flavors. [The mixers are] about 80 calories per serving.”</p><p>This week, the Just Add X team launched their newest flavor called Blue Teaz which is a blueberry-black tea. Other flavors include strawberry-basil, ginger-lime and jalapeño-cucumber.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For Bass’ 41st birthday, even the members of <a href=#>‘NSync</a> got a taste of Just Add X. “They threw a surprise [Zoom] party for me!” the former boy bander tells Us. “There were three different rooms and the very first room I went into, it was all the ‘NSync boys and we all had boxes in front of us. So we opened up our boxes and have to do an activity and we made an *NSYNC-o de Mayo cocktail using the Just Add X cucumber jalapeño mix and just had such a good time.”</p><p>The Out of Sync author tells Us that quarantine Zoom parties have bonded the ‘NSync members. “Yeah we’ve definitely been in touch way more. I mean we talk weekly anyway, but this has definitely bonded us even more. [My birthday] was just a very fun surprise. I had no idea that was going to happen. So it was a pleasant surprise to just jump into a Zoom to celebrate ‘NSync-o de Mayo.”</p><p>Just Add X premium mixers by Lance Bass, Jax Taylor and James Kirtley are available at <a href=#>www.justaddx.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqOZqGLBosXLqKlmmZ6Zeq2tzZycZpqRqMBuucixnKurXZa%2FpnnPnqmfnZOpeqe70WaYrWWYpLqmecKomqSskZ65tHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kannon-valentine-james.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kannon Valentine James</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gena-colley-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gena Colley Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
