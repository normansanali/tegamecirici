Affleck, who has been open about his history of alcoholism, admitted to the radio host that he would “probably still be drinking” if he’d stayed married to Garner. “It’s part of why I started drinking,” he continued. “Because I was trapped.” He went on to add that they “grew apart” ahead of their divorce. “We had a marriage that didn’t work, this happens, with somebody that I love and respect, but to whom I shouldn’t be married any longer,” he told Stern. “Ultimately, we tried. We tried, we tried because we had kids.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckx963jp100103h6ghvvt4pj5@published data-word-count=160>Sorry to Jennifer Garner, who did not ask to be dragged into this press cycle! Affleck’s comments prompted immediate and expected backlash online, to the point where he clarified them on a new <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel Live! appearance</a> on December 15. Affleck brought up the Stern interview unprompted, admitting he was “really happy with it” in the moment. When he saw coverage of the interview later, he said, some outlets “made it seem as if I was saying the exact opposite of what I said.” Affleck insisted that his comments on Garner had focused on “how much we respect each other and cared about each other and cared about our kids and put them first and went through our stuff.” He also seemed to imply he did not say he felt “trapped” in the marriage, despite literally using that word on Stern. Affleck, who shares three children with Garner, added, “If it’s about my kids, I gotta just draw a line.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckx9719km00173h6g1ap33n2d@published data-word-count=97>Still, the star doesn’t seem to have been protected from the fallout. Garner hasn’t directly responded to the comments, although she was spotted looking, <a href=#>by account of “Page Six,”</a> “unfazed” on a walk in Santa Monica afterward. <a href=#>As for Affleck’s current girlfriend, J.Lo</a>? One source <a href=#>told “Page Six”</a> she “is pissed” about the comments. “She doesn’t want to be dragged into this,” the source added, noting that Lopez is trying to form a relationship with Garner and their children. “It’s reckless and cavalier of him,” the source said. Those Jens have to stick up for each other.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckxernomq000i3e6klh3jdo8t@published data-word-count=135><strong>Update, Monday, December 20 at 9:45 a.m.: </strong>Not so fast, says Jennifer Lopez. The star set the record straight after a “Page Six” source claimed she was “pissed” about Ben Affleck’s recent comments on ex-wife Jennifer Garner. “This story is simply not true,” J.Lo herself <a href=#>told People</a> on December 18. “It is not how I feel.” The star added that she “couldn’t have more respect for Ben as a father, a co-parent, and a person.” Meanwhile, a People source in the same report said they are “in a really great space and really happy,” and the pair “look forward to spending time with their children” this Christmas. The couple had recently been spotted <a href=#>holding hands</a> on their way to Affleck’s Jimmy Kimmel Live! interview on December 15, where Affleck cleared up his comments toward Garner.</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>page six</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>page six</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckot4m5la0000dponcgkrjm8o@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Complete 19-Year Timeline of the Bennifer Saga</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckwno9ovr0000p0om9er4jrte@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Ben Affleck Says Just ‘Imagine’ How He and Jennifer Lopez Reconnected</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckuitbvxb00007ioj30f4vyj9@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Ben Affleck Plays Himself</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Now Why Is Ben Affleck Dragging Jennifer Garner Into This?</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpamdhZ3yjsc1mmJ%2BenJqwrHnOp2SjnZ6jtqex0Waemqqemr9usMivpqublWKur7CMnamippueu6h5xZqjpaelqXupwMyl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shiftry-tcg.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shiftry (TCG) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./245187-larry-june-makes-music-to-cruise-to-with-adjust-to-the-game-new-mixtape.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Larry June Makes Music To Cruise To With &amp;quot;Adjust To The Game&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
