Biography & Parents Details</strong></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Kate Cox is a pregnant woman from Dallas, who can't get an abortion for now after the Texas Supreme Court has paused a judge's decision. As per records, she had two pregnancies in the past, and both pregnancies weren't easy as she had a cesarean surgery for both deliveries. Records even show that she wants a D&E abortion to protect her life, health, and future fertility. She has already been rushed to the emergency room four times with cramping and fluid loss. At the same time, Kate Cox is yet to have a Wikipedia page.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Kate Cox was born to her parents in Texas, USA. However, there is no information regarding her parents in the public media. Moreover, she has always remained private about her parents and hasn't talked much about them on any form of social media handles. Meanwhile, her parents are yet to make a public appearance after the legal fight of their daughter against the State of Texas. Other than that, there is no information regarding her siblings, so it's hard to tell the number of brothers and sisters she has.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Kate Cox was born somewhere in 1992 which makes her 31 years old at the time of writing. However, at this moment, it's hard to tell when she enjoys celebrating her birthday and what her zodiac or birth sign is. Meanwhile, as Kate Cox was born in Texas, USA, she holds American nationality. At the same time, Kate Cox comes from a family of white ethnic background and follows Christianity as her religion.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Regarding her educational background, there is no solid proof to support her educational journey.

As per records, she along with her husband lives in the greater Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in Texas. However, it's hard to tell when they have been married. Based on all available records, the couple has been together for at least 4 years. Her husband has always remained with her throughout her fight against the state.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>From her years of married life, she is a mother to two kids, a 3-year-old daughter and a 1-and-a-half-year-old son.

During her ultrasound in October 2023, she found her baby had a single umbilical artery where there should have been two and a spine abnormality. Her physicians informed her that continuing the pregnancy would pose risks to her health as well.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>The safest option to protect her health and future fertility was to get a D&E abortion.
