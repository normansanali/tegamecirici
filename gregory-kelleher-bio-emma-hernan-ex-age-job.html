Keep reading this Gregory Kelleher Bio to uncover his secrets.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Gregory Kelleher, Emma Hernan Ex</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Gregory Kelleher is Emma Hernan’s ex. The two were spotted in a now-deleted photo posted to Emma’s mother’s Instagram page, where they were seen sharing a kiss by the seashore.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since the photo was shared back in 2014, it makes sense that Emma might have gotten engaged to her ex more than five years ago.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, as for the link between Gregory and Christine Quinn, there were no credential records of them being together. However, Christine claiming the two were a couple is enough to establish a link between them.
