We’re in love!”</p><p>Three months after Cutler proposed to Cavallari, the pair split, <a href=#>only to reunite in November 2011</a>.</p><p>“At that moment, something wasn’t right,” Cavallari wrote in her 2016 book, <a href=#>Balancing in Heels</a>. “A few things needed to change, and I knew the only way Jay would see how serious I was, was if I ended the relationship.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Laguna Beach</a> alum revealed in her book that the pair saw a therapist to rebuild their relationship, which “opened up our eyes to the other person’s perspective and gave us great tools for communication.”</p><p>After rekindling their romance, the duo welcomed their first child, Camden, in August 2012. Less than a year later, <a href=#>they tied the knot in June 2013</a>.</p><p>The former Chicago Bears quarterback and the <a href=#>Hills</a> alum welcomed their second son, Jaxon, in May 2014 and their daughter, Saylor, less than two years later in November 2015.</p><p>The couple hit another rocky patch while <a href=#>trying to navigate their new roles</a> of Cutler being retired — <a href=#>he left the NFL in 2017</a> — and Cavallari launching her lifestyle company. During a February 2019 episode of Very Cavallari, the Colorado native said their marriage was “in a serious funk” and called out her husband for not being as supportive as she needed.</p><p>A few episodes later, <a href=#>Cavallari spoke out about her and Cutler’s relationship status</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Jay has been great, yes. From the outside, like, things are so perfect and things are so great,” she told friends during an April 2019 episode of the E! series. “But actually, like, they’re not. And that sucks. It sucks. That’s the thing, though, with marriage — it’s ups and downs. <a href=#>Right now we’re in a low</a>, but in two months we could be up here again. And that’s how we’ve always been, our whole relationship. It is what it is.”</p><p>A year later, the couple <a href=#>announced their split</a> after spending time together in the Bahamas as a family amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Scroll down to see all of Cavallari and Cutler’s <a href=#>ups and downs</a> over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuLO10q2gp2WTlsOiuMuaqaJlmpbGbq%2FUraOeqqNiwrG%2FjJqlnWWUpMSvv4ytn6unpZy1bsDHnmSynZGnwHC5wLJka2hhaXp6ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lauren-bushnell-carhartt-beanie-hat-winter-celebrity-style-fashion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lauren Bushnell Showed Us How to Rock This Iconic Carhartt Beanie</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heres-what-started-lil-waynes-beef-with-50-cent.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's What Started Lil Wayne's Beef With 50 Cent</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
