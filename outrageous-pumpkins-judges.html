The company carves and ships pumpkins across the United States.</p><p>As a seasoned artist of the pumpkin variety, Marc truly is the perfect person to judge everyone else’s carved pumpkin creations. If his latest <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> post is any indication, there’s only one part of the judging process he doesn’t like: having to send contestants off.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“The hardest part of being on a competition show is knowing that you have to send someone home,” he wrote while reflecting on his second Outrageous Pumpkins experience recently. “And every competitor was a great artist and a wonderful person.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is ‘Outrageous Pumpkins’ judge Terri Hardin?</h2><p>Terri, Outrageous Pumpkins’ second judge this season, isn’t just an artist and professional speaker. 2021’s Food Network pumpkin carving contestants also have the opportunity to be judged by a Disney Imagineer.</p><p>This design extraordinaire spends a lot of her time teaching people how to carve pumpkins like a pro, among other artistic feats. You can actually take some of her classes if you want to learn from one of Disney’s legendary creators.
