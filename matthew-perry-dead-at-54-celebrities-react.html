He was in his 50s.”</p><p>According to TMZ, no drugs were found at the scene and no foul play is suspected.</p><p>Stars immediately flooded social media to <a href=#>pay tribute to the late star on Saturday.</a></p><p>“RIP Matthew Perry, 54,” Piers Morgan tweeted. “The Friends star was a great actor, but by his own admission, a very tormented guy. His recent autobiography about his addiction-ravaged life was one of the most powerful, honest and revealing I’ve ever read. Such sad news.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Matthew Perry in November 2022. <span class=credit>Getty Images for GQ</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Matthew Perry’s home where he was found dead at age 54 on Saturday. <span class=credit>BACKGRID</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Police on scene at Matthew Perry’s home following his death at age 54. <span class=credit>BACKGRID</span></figure><p>Olivia Munn, for her part, wrote: “He struggled so much with addiction and was brave enough to be open and honest about it.

I told him so when I recurred on The Odd Couple. He smiled so big I thought he’d crack his face,” she tweeted on X, formerly known as Twitter. “It was beautiful.”</p><p>Melissa Joan Hart also took to the platform.</p><p>“I’m shocked, we all are!
