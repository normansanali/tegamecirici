This move has left many wondering why Franklin chose to leave FSU and seek opportunities elsewhere. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind Franklin's departure and analyze the factors that contributed to his decision.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Desire for More Playing Time</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>One of the main factors that led to Franklin's departure from FSU was his desire for more playing time. Franklin, who was considered the second-string quarterback in the spring, missed the spring game due to injury. This setback likely impacted his chances of securing the starting quarterback position at FSU. With the addition of transfer quarterback Everett Golson, who was expected to compete for the starting job, Franklin may have felt that his opportunities for playing time were diminishing.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Positional Uncertainty</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Another reason for Franklin's departure from FSU was the uncertainty surrounding his position on the team. While Franklin played as a quarterback at FSU, he also expressed a desire to play a position that would allow him to have more opportunities with the ball. This suggests that Franklin may have felt that his skills were not being fully utilized in the quarterback position. The decision to transfer could have been driven by a desire to find a position that better suited his abilities and allowed him to contribute more to the team.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>History of Transferring</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Franklin's decision to transfer from FSU is not an isolated incident. In fact, this will be his fourth school in the last five seasons. Franklin has a history of transferring due to dissatisfaction with playing time and competition. He left FSU because he couldn't beat out Jameis Winston and is now leaving Auburn because he wasn't named the starting or backup quarterback. This pattern of transferring suggests that Franklin may have difficulty adjusting to competition and may be unwilling to stay at one school for a prolonged period of time.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Seeking Opportunities Closer to Home</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In addition to the desire for more playing time and positional uncertainty, Franklin's decision to transfer may also have been influenced by a desire to be closer to home. Franklin, who recently graduated from Auburn University, expressed a desire to play his final year of eligibility closer to home. This suggests that personal factors, such as family and support systems, may have played a role in Franklin's decision to leave FSU.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>John Franklin's decision to transfer from FSU was influenced by several factors. His desire for more playing time, uncertainty about his position on the team, and history of transferring all contributed to his decision. Additionally, personal factors such as the desire to be closer to home may have played a role in his choice to seek opportunities elsewhere. While it is uncertain how long Franklin will stay at Florida Atlantic University, it is clear that his decision to transfer reflects his desire for a better fit and more opportunities on the football field.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn7JllJ6xbrbOoaVmnqKWu6y4yKdkpZ2Rq7JustKu</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./11-secrets-popeyes-doesnt-want-you-to-know-eat-this-not-that.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>11 Secrets Popeyes Doesnt Want You to Know Eat This Not That</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-comedian-wally-bayola-video-takes-over-domain-6-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Comedian Wally Bayola?
