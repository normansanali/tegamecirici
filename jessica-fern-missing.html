People are getting more concerned as time passes without any <a href=#>news</a> of her.</p><p>Recently, there’s been a mix of both hope and worry. Jessica’s dog, Honzo, was found near where her phone was last traced, at Surprise Beach.&nbsp;</p><p>In response to this situation, both the police and the community are working together. They understand that finding Jessica is significant.</p><p>It’s not just a job for the police; everyone in the community is joining in the effort. They want to bring Jessica back safely and solve the mystery of her disappearance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Inside the Jessica Fern disappearance&nbsp;</h2><p>The day was August 15, 2023, when Jessica Fern departed from her Ridgefield residence.&nbsp;</p><p>Little did anyone know that this simple departure would ignite a sequence of events that would grip the community in worry and prompt them to mobilise in search of answers.&nbsp;</p><p>It was around 6 p.m. when her presence at home ceased, leaving behind an air of uncertainty.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A distinct disappearance and companion</h2><p>Jessica’s attire was distinguishable on that specific day, allowing for easy identification.&nbsp;</p><p>Her distinctive physical features, including brown hair and eyes, further contributed to her recognisable appearance.</p><p>However, beyond her visual traits, another notable aspect was the presence of her devoted companion, Honzo.&nbsp;</p><p>Honzo, characterised as a tan Irish wolfhound/German Shepherd hybrid, shared in her journey, accentuating the profound bond between humans and their animal companions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The last known location of Jessica Fern&nbsp;</h2><p>Jessica’s phone held a clue – a trace that led to Surprise Beach, nestled along the Vancouver, Washington waterfront.</p><p>&nbsp;However, despite this trace, her phone remained elusive.&nbsp;</p><p>The mystery of her last known location deepened the urgency among authorities and the community, spurring them to action.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A community search and concern</h2><p>The disappearance of Jessica Fern didn’t just affect her immediate circle;
