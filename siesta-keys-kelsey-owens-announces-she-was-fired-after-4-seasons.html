Not even a simple ‘thank you for sharing the past 5 years of your life with us.'”</p><p>In her lengthy social media post, the former MTV personality <a href=#>reflected on her first reaction to the news</a>, adding, “I cried my eyes out then wiped those tears and filmed my last scene the best I could with my head held high. Despite the way things were handled I am so grateful for the friends I’ve made, once in a lifetime opportunities I’ve been given, and most of all the fans. I wish I could hug each & every one of you.”</p><p>The Missouri native noted that <a href=#>her time on the show had a major impact</a> on her life. “You have no idea how much your kind words and support have meant to me and how much they’ve helped me get through some of my toughest times,” she continued. “I couldn’t have made it these past 5 years without y’all so thank you for that. I am truly a better person because of y’all. My time on the show may have come to an end but this is just the beginning for me. 💗Time to strut my way into this next chapter.”</p><p>Owens, <a href=#>who appeared on Siesta Key since its debut in 2017</a>, previously revealed that she was thinking of leaving the series. Earlier this year, Owens, <a href=#><strong>Juliette Porter</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Madisson Hausburg</strong></a> discussed the model’s future amid her relationship with <strong>Max Strong</strong>.</p><p>“Kelsey’s been dating her boyfriend Max for a while now. He moved from Kentucky to Siesta Key to be with her, which was a pretty big step,” Porter, 25, said during a confessional interview in March. “And even though Max had just moved to be with her — Kelsey had been having some doubts recently about if she even wanted to stay in Florida.”</p><p>At the time, Owens admitted that she was considering a move to Los Angeles<a href=#> even if it meant leaving Siesta Key</a>. “It’s definitely something I’ve thought about a lot but also it’s hard because Max just moved here,” she told Hausburg, 27. “I just feel like more and more recently I have kind of been pushed out of the group. I don’t want it to be like that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Two months later, the TV personality opened up about her plans during an Instagram Q&A. “I’m staying in FL for myself NO ONE else,” Owens wrote in May in response to a fan question about a potential departure.</p><p>Us Weekly has reached out to MTV for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqinaOprm63xLKqZqOVocCmxYyorp6mo2Kur7rOrqWcnaNiwKmxjLCYrGWWnr%2BmsIyana2domKBbr%2FEmqqopqNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-garvey-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Steve Garvey Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rob-gronkowski-tom-brady-celebrated-nfc-win-together.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rob Gronkowski, Tom Brady Celebrated NFC Win Together</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
