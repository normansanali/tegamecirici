Nevertheless, basically it is same as Kamehameha that can go into the weaker people without killing them or to beat someone stonger if the stronger one is not aware enough.</p><h2>Does hakai only work on people weaker than you?</h2><p>No. Frieza was able to take it and throw it away. Beerus was able to just blow it away, literally. It’s basically just another Ki attack and if the user is weaker than it won’t hurt the opponent.</p><h2>What does Hakai work on?</h2><p>As Gods of Destruction, they possess the power to destroy almost anything with little effort, even intangible beings such as souls. People killed by Hakai do not go to Other World and simply cease to exist. Despite this, Destruction cannot be used to kill immortals.</p><h2>What are the limits of Hakai?</h2><p>As far as we know, Beerus’s Hakai has no limits, but presumably, it wouldn’t work against Zeno because he’s omnipotent according to the Supreme Kais.</p><h2>Can Beerus use Hakai on anyone?</h2><p>It doesn’t matter if you’re an animal, mineral or ghost; there is nothing in the universe Lord Beerus can’t destroy. Whis to Dr. Mashirito after Beerus used the Hakai on the latter in “Goku vs. Arale!</p><h2>Beerus Has Disturbing Hidden Power – His True Strength is Beyond Broken! (How Strong is Beerus?)</h2><h2>Who can defeat Beerus easily?</h2><p>As of Currently, The only people who threaten Beerus in power, Is Whis, The angels ,Zeno(Technically not in power, Atleast probably, But Zeno can just erase Beerus on the spot), Grand priest. That’s literally about it.</p><h2>Who can Beerus not beat?</h2><p>Bulma is Dragon Ball’s Only Hero Who Can Stop Beerus</p><p>While Goku and Bulma began this journey together, the two picked up Oolong along the way, as Bulma believed his shapeshifting would come in handy.</p><h2>Can Saitama survive Hakai?</h2><p>For years, anime fans have questioned whether or not Goku can beat Saitama, and he most definitely can. After achieving his Perfected Super Saiyan Blue form, Goku gained the ability to use Hakai, which is used by Gods of Destruction to erase beings from existence. Even Saitama cannot survive such an ability.</p><h2>Can Hakai erase someone stronger than you?</h2><p>Yes absolutely. Goku used it on Zamasu, who was much stronger than him.</p><h2>Can Goku use ultra ego?</h2><p>Unlike Ultra Instinct, Ultra Ego can be tapped into easily by the user once they awaken it completely. As seen during the Tournament of Power, Goku struggled to do that with his ability, and it wasn’t until much later in the manga that he finally mastered it.</p><h2>Is there a counter to Hakai?</h2><p>There’s basically no counter for Hakai, and once it starts, it will result in the target’s erasure. It’s only supposed to be used in emergencies because of its deadly impact.</p><h2>Does hakai work on anyone?</h2><p>Overview. It doesn’t matter if you’re an animal, mineral or ghost; there is nothing in the universe Lord Beerus can’t destroy. Whis to Dr. Mashirito after Beerus used the Hakai on the latter in “Goku vs.</p><h2>Would hakai work on Hulk?</h2><p>So hulk doesn’t have resistance to existence erasure so by that extent the hakai would work, if it wasn’t for the fact that the hakai doesn’t work on beings stronger than the user. So in order for Beerus to hakai hulk he’d need to be stronger than hulk.</p><h2>Can Goku beat Saitama?</h2><p>Saitama is a man that can defeat any foe with a single punch. If the two of them were to face off in a one-on-one battle, Saitama would easily win. The fight wouldn’t last a second let alone enough time for Goku to transform into a Super Saiyan.</p><h2>Can Goku overpower Hax?</h2><p>He has limited resistance to haxx. Not immune to it. It is literally power greater than haxx. Goku needs to become stronger by powering up to overpower haxx.</p><h2>Can Goku ever beat Beerus?</h2><p>Only One Dragon Ball Hero Can Beat Beerus… And It’s Not Goku – IMDb. While Dragon Ball’s Goku has unlocked god-like powers of his own, he still doesn’t stand a chance against Lord Beerus, the God of Destruction if the two were to ever fight again.</p><h2>Can you resist hakai?</h2><p>Characters have demonstrated the ability to resist hakai. None of them were ever on the receiving end of a “full” hakai, though. Frieza resisted a ball of hakai, but it was small enough for a mortal to carry.</p><h2>Can Hakai erase Zeno?</h2><p>Well, assuming that zen-oh is the strongest in the multiverse or whatever, Beerus’ Hakai would not kill Zen-oh. The Hakai has been shown to not necessarily work against people that are stronger than the caster as we see with Sidra’s Hakai being used on Golden Frieza and Goku.</p><h2>Can Hakai erase Zamasu?</h2><p>In the manga, Goku initially believes that Hakai can destroy an immortal like Future Zamasu, but Beerus later confirms it cannot. In the anime, Goku believes it cannot destroy an immortal, which Whis then indirectly supports by saying they have a sealing technique to deal with Zamasu.</p><h2>Can Lord Beerus beat Saitama?</h2><p>Beerus, no question. Saitama’s best feats (getting kicked to the moon and jumping back to earth, splitting a life wiping energy beam, destroying a giant meteor etc) would barely place him at Namek Saga levels by DB standards.</p><h2>Can Beerus destroy Saitama?</h2><p>Can Beerus (DBS) beat Saitama (OPM) in a fight? Yes, and quite easily.</p><h2>Can Saitama surpass Beerus?</h2><p>The answer to this question is no. Saitama can’t beat Beerus. Saitama might be strong and all but he is completely outmatched when faced against Lord Beerus the destroyer and here are a few points as to why I am saying this: Beerus is a couple of million of years old, he’s way older than Saitama.</p><h2>Who is the 2nd strongest god of destruction?</h2><p>This list has been updated to add more information in hopes of answering who is the most powerful God of Destruction.</p><li>1 Beerus (Universe 7)</li><li>2 Belmod (Universe 11) …</li><li>3 Champa (Universe 6) …</li><li>4 Sidra (Universe 9) …</li><li>5 Quitela (Universe 4) …</li><li>6 Mule (Universe 3) …</li><li>7 Heles (Universe 2) …</li><li>8 Giin (Universe 12) …</li><h2>Can black Frieza beat Beerus?</h2><p>5 Beerus – Universe 7’s God Of Destruction</p><p>He’s easily strong enough to destroy Black Frieza in an instant if he desires to do so. The fact that Frieza still submits to Beerus is clear proof of their different power levels.</p><h2>Can Goku surpass Zeno?</h2><p>That said, it really does seem like Zeno will stay the strongest god in Dragon Ball for the foreseeable future. His level of power is so incomprehensible that it seems highly unlikely Goku will ever fight Zeno, let alone beat him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWWlr5wsM6eqmagkaCuqnnWqKmkZZ%2BjerTA0ailoJ2iYryxvM6nnKeso2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dredd-superfiend-watch-full-trailer-judge-deaths-origin-story-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dredd: Superfiend: Watch This Full Trailer For Judge Deaths Origin Story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./woody-allen-net-worth-amid-scandals.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Did His Career Scandals Cost Him To Lose Work?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
