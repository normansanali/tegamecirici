According to sources, Brita and Gordon’s relationship evolved while they shared a rooming house in Toronto’s Annex district. They got married in Stockholm, Brita’s hometown in 1963 and vacationed in Ireland after spending their first summer together in London, England, where Lightfoot was a cast member of a BBC TV show. Their union was blessed with 2 kids, Fred and Ingrid. The birth of their first and second child made Lightfoot tour even more to support his expanding family. Unfortunately, this made Lightfoot spend a lot of time away from home, leading to the end of his marriage in 1973.</p><p>Meanwhile, Brita had been said to be hugely supportive of Lightfoot’s career. With her level head and mathematical skills, she’d been a willing sounding board and shrewd financial advisor according to sources. But Lightfoot’s frequent absences and his affairs with other women in towns and cities where he performed had put a strain on their marriage. There was jealousy, mistrust, and a growing distance between them—and no apparent way to bridge the gap.</p><p>Lightfoot later acknowledged that his musical touring and the fact that he found fidelity difficult in a long-distance relationship contributed to the failure of at least two of his relationships. The song “If You Could Read My Mind” was written in reflection upon his disintegrating marriage. He sang the song’s lyrics with a small adjustment at his daughter, Ingrid’s request: the line “I’m just trying to understand the feelings that you lack” has been changed to “I’m just trying to understand the feelings that we lack.”</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Gordon Lightfoot Cause of Death</a></strong></p><p><strong>Gordon Lightfoot Married Elizabeth Moon 16 Years after Divorcing Brita</strong></p><p>After Lightfoot’s divorce from Brita, the musical superstar waited for about 16 years before getting married again, this time to Elizabeth Moon in 1989. However, with the long period between the singer’s first and second marriages, he fathered 2 kids from 2 women whose identities have remained in the shadows. These kids are Gaylen McGee and Eric.</p><p>With Elizabeth Moon, Gordon had his fifth and sixth children; Meredith Moon and Miles Lightfoot. Just like his first marriage, things did not work out too well for Gordon and Elizabeth. Although Gordon later claimed they had been apart for nine years prior to the official split, they divorced in 2011.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kim_Hasse_Ramained_Gordon_Lightfoots_Wife_Until_His_Passing></span><strong>Kim Hasse Ramained Gordon Lightfoot’s Wife Until His Passing</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/jukebugs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Gordon-Lightfoot-Wife-1.jpg><p>Gordon’s third and final marriage was with Kim Hasse and the duo tied the knot on the 1st of December 2014. Kim was born on April 4 1961 and is currently <span>62 years old. She appears to be the most popular of all the women Gordon has married before as she is known for movies like My Sister’s Keeper (2009),&nbsp;Pleasantville (1998),&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Brady Bunch Movie (1995).&nbsp;</span></p><p>Kim and Gordon remained together <a href=# rel=noopener>until his passing </a>on the 1st of May 2023 <a href=# rel=noopener>aged 84.</a> Prior to his death, Kim’s husband had a deteriorating health condition that mostly affected his stomach since 2002. More so, in September 14, 2006, while in the middle of a performance, Lightfoot suffered a minor stroke that eventually left him without the use of the middle and ring fingers on his right hand.</p><p>Earlier in April 2023, Lightfoot canceled his upcoming U.S. and Canada tour dates due to health issues according to press statements.</p><p>Gordon and Kim were nine years into their marriage before Godon’s death was announced. Also, they did not have any children together.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51ktLC%2Bw6ilZqSZnLW1ss6oq2avmZuybrnEnqtmrJiaerW00Z6cZq%2BforKveceeZLCZo2K6or7RopydZaSkfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-haynes-net-worth-229357.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mike Haynes Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lebron-james-parents.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>LeBron James Was Raised by a Single Mother Who Had Him When She Was a Teenager</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
