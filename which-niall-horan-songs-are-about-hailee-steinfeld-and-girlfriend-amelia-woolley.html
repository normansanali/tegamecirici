And just like any other artist, his songs also reflect his relationships. His second studio album, "Heartbreak Weather," which was released in March 2020 made fans wonder if the tracks on the album shed light on his past relationship with singer-actress Hailee Steinfeld. Their romance began in February 2018, unfortunately, the couple called it quits in December of the same year, leaving fans craving for details about their breakup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Niall Horan's Girlfriend Amelia Woolley Have A Relationship With His Former One Direction Bandmates?</a></span></p><p>Three years later, Horan started teasing his fans with hints about his third studio album, "The Show," released in June 2023.

Slowly the album became a concept album and was less about me and more about different relationships and maybe that feeling that at the start of a relationship, you're not that trusting and this song kind of talks about, when I call you up, you might miss a name out when I ask you who's around, and you're not breaking the rules, but you're kind of bending them…"</p><h2 id=niall-horan-wrote-quot-put-a-little-love-on-me-quot-after-his-split-with-hailee-steinfeld><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Niall Horan Wrote "Put A Little Love On Me" After His Split With Hailee Steinfeld</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/th-image-template-2-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Put a Little Love on Me" is widely considered one of the most melancholic tracks on Niall Horan's "Heartbreak Weather" album. During an interview with The Sun, Horan revealed the inspiration behind the song, stating, "Put A Little Love On Me" I wrote when it was raining, and it's like, 'I'm sad, we're finished, put a little love on me'. It was one of those ones which was a tough write. It was very early, and it was very raw when I was writing it, but I think one of my favorite songs I've ever written."</p><p>Fans were quick to speculate and suggest a possible connection to his previous flame in this song. The reason behind this stems from the presence of a girl in the song's music video who resembles Hailee Steinfeld.</p><h2 id=is-niall-horan-39-s-quot-san-fransisco-quot-about-hailee-steinfeld><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Is Niall Horan's "San Fransisco" About Hailee Steinfeld?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/th-image-template-1-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Niall Horan called "San Francisco" a song that captures the essence of "relationship beginnings and the desire to revisit those early moments."

It was based on the start of the relationship and wanting to go back to where it started. The song was called 'Take Me Back' but I changed it to "San Francisco" because the song is basically about San Francisco and the area."

"There's so much pressure for people to hit certain milestones by a certain age...
