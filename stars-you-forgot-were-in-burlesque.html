She unknowingly walks into a burlesque club run by Tess (Cher), which is facing financial hardship despite its talented group of dancers.</p><p>Ali wants to audition but finds herself working at the club as a waitress. The film follows Ali as she fights her way from the bar to the stage while juggling a love triangle between sensitive bartender Jack (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cam Gigandet</strong></a>) and wealthy real estate developer Marcus (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Eric Dane</strong></a>).</p><p>Aguilera told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider </a>in November 2010 that she wanted Ali’s character to be rewritten before she agreed to sign on to the project.</p><p>“They had to rewrite the character because I was just like, ‘This girl doesn’t have a lot of drive,'” she said at the time. “‘She doesn’t have enough meat. I think you should give it to someone else.’ I had an initial meeting with Amy Pascal and Clint Culpepper, and I said, ‘I just don’t think she’s for me. I want someone <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with more bite and more passion</a> for what she wants in life.’ And so, they rewrote it.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The “Dirrty” singer </a>added that she channeled her lack of acting experience into the character.</p><p>“I also had to have a balance of starting out very vulnerable and wide-eyed and naive,” she explained. “I put that energy into how I really was feeling, approaching acting in the first place, which was wide-eyed and as a newcomer, who was open and vulnerable to everyone’s opinions and ideas, and ready to learn.”</p><p>Aguilera and Cher developed a close bond behind-the-scenes of the film that emulated their characters’ budding mother-daughter relationship in the movie. The “Believe” singer told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a> in November 2010 that she felt an immediate connection to Aguilera, whom she tried to mentor during filming.</p><p>“She reminded me of the relationship that I had with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Meryl Streep</strong></a> [on Silkwood], when Meryl took me under her wing,” she said at the time. “The truth was that I didn’t have any idea where to stand, not that I know where to stand now. I just learned what downstage and upstage is. But, Christina worked so hard. She overcame a lot. She came on the set with us, and that’s a little bit nerve-wracking when you’ve done nothing in film. I tried to put her at ease. As time went by, she felt a lot more comfortable.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Although Cher enjoyed her time working on the movie, she admitted in 2013 that she wasn’t proud of the project.</p><p>“It wasn’t a good film,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Moonstruck star </a>told the Los Angeles Times. “It had a few good moments, but I didn’t even like my performance that much. What, I don’t have a brain? I’m old but I’m still pretty on top of everything.”</p><p>Scroll down to see stars you may have forgot appeared in Burlesque.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BowaK%2B0mawqK1dm7yzs86tZLCdopp6qrqMm6yrpJWovraxjpyYpmWXnrSiusOeq2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wigs-for-natural-hair-growth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wigs As a Protective Style</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pioneer-in-the-ways-of-being-a-nun-in-the-modern-world.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pioneer in the ways of beinga nun in the modern world</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
