During Lyor’s career as a music industry executive now spanning more than 30 years, he has worked with such celebrities as <a href=#>Jay-Z</a>, <a href=#>Russell Simmons</a>, <a href=#>Jon Bon Jovi</a> and many others.</p><p>So just how rich is Lyor Cohen? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that Cohen’s net worth is over $75 million, as of mid-2016. There is a high possibility that Lyor’s net worth will become higher in the future as he now also heads the record label 300 Entertainment.</p><h3>Lyor Cohen Net Worth $75 Million</h3><p>Lyor grew up in Los Angeles, but graduated from University of Miami in 1981 with a degree in global marketing and finance. Cohen’s career in music started when he began to work in Rush Productions, and while working there he had an opportunity to meet the Beastie Boys, <a href=#>Kurtis Blow</a>, <a href=#>LL Cool J</a> and others. Lyor’s career in Rush Productions was successful and gave him more experience in the music industry, as well as laying the foundation of his net worth.</p><p>Cohen then went to work in Def Jam,&nbsp; and in 1999 he became the president of the Island Def Jam Music Group, which was formed by emerging Island Records, Def Jam and Mercury Records, and which quickly became very popular and successful as Cohen had an opportunity to work with such famous performers as <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a>, <a href=#>Elvis Costello</a>, <a href=#>Ashanti</a>, <a href=#>Slipknot</a>, Nickelback and many others. The success of Island Def Jam Music Group, including the separation from Sony and linking with PolyGram, positively effected the growth of Lyor Cohen’s net worth.</p><p>In 2000 Lyor formed Lost Highway Records, and again Cohen was very successful at this business, as with every decision he took success and popularity only grew, not to mention Lyor’s net worth becoming higher as well.</p><p>Another step in his career as a music industry executive was when Lyor became the chief executive and chairman of the Warner Music Group. Lyor wrote agreements with Spotify and YouTube, which only made the artists of Warner Music Group more popular through increased exposure. However, despite the fact that Lyor was very successful while working at Warner Music Group, in 2012 he decided to leave and create 300 Entertainment. There is no doubt that this company will also be successful and will contribute to Lyor Cohen’s net worth growth.</p><p>In is personal life, Lyor Cohen was married to Amy from 1990 to 2006, and they have a son and a daughter.</p><p>In addition to Lyor’s career as a music industry executive he also has some philanthropic activities. He is an acting director of Boys & Girls Harbor, charity organization, and is currently on the board of the <a title="Rock and Roll Hall of Fame" href=#>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>,</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=10.427689594356><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Lyor Cohen</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$75 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 3, 1959</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Manhattan, New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.96&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>CEO, Chairman of recorded music of Warner Music Group, American music industry executive</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>University of Miami, John Marshall High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Amy Cohen (m. 1990–2006)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Bea Cohen, Az Cohen</td></tr><tr readability=0.37209302325581><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/LyorCohen13</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/lyorcohen</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0169567</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Music Groups</td><td>Island Def Jam Music Group, Island Records, Def Jam, Mercury Records</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=7.8224687933426><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>(26 January) Leaves Island/Def Jam after 21 years to become head of U.S. recorded music operations of Warner Music Group.
