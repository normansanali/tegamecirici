After all, one of the most famous people in North America, Kim Kardashian, owes her fame to a personal video of hers that was leaked and a long-lasting “reality” show. On the other hand, since there are so many celebrities these days, it seems like the vast majority of them disappear before long, even if some of those folks <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">aren’t aware</a> their time in the spotlight is over.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Arguably one of the first celebrities who rose to fame in a new way, during the ‘90s Elizabeth Hurley became a sensation after she attended an event with Hugh Grant and wore a revealing dress. Unlike a lot of other celebrities who came to prominence for things like that, however, Hurley has been famous for decades at this point, mostly due to her successful acting career.</p><p>Even though Elizabeth Hurley is talented at her craft of choice, acting, there is no doubt that her extremely good looks have also contributed to her success to a certain degree. After all, she is such a captivating beauty that it can be hard to look away from here. Since so many people are jealous of the people Hurley has dated over the years, people are always interested in her love life, including whether or not she is single as of the time of this writing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Not-So-Sweet Story Of How Kim Kardashian Became A Billionaire</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elizabeth-s-most-famous-relationship>Elizabeth’s Most Famous Relationship</h2><p>After the release of Four Weddings and a Funeral in the year 1994, Hugh Grant instantly became one of the most beloved romantic comedy stars in the world. After all, he was so lovable in that film that it made millions of viewers swoon over him. Unfortunately for most people, at that time Grant was romantically linked to Elizabeth Hurley and for a long while, it seemed like they would spend the rest of their lives together.</p><p>When Elizabeth Hurley landed a role in a little-seen film called Remando Al Viento, she had no idea it would be one of the most important events in her life. While Hurley’s appearance in that movie did nothing of note for her career, Hugh Grant headlined that film and after the two actors met on set, they became a couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on some reports, Hugh Grant <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">isn’t as charming as he seems</a> in real life. However, he clearly was charismatic enough to capture the heart of one of the most beautiful women in the world as he dated Elizabeth Hurley for roughly 13 years. While their split must have been very painful for both actors, according to what Hurley told People in October 2020, Grant is still <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her “go-to person”</a> in a lot of situations.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Was Hugh Grant Too Brutally Honest About His Former Female Co-Stars?</a></span></p><h2 id=hurley-s-other-relationships>Hurley’s Other Relationships</h2><p>In the years since Elizabeth Hurley and Hugh Grant went their separate ways, she has been involved with several men. Most notably, in late-2002 Hurley started dating Arun Nayar, an Indian textile heir who was running a software company when the couple met. After dating for several years, Nayar and Hurley got married in 2007. Unfortunately, in 2010 the couple separated and the following year their divorce was finalized.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A few months after Elizabeth Hurley’s divorce was granted she got engaged to Shane Warne, a former Australian cricketer. Ultimately, the couple would never walk down the aisle as they split in late-2013. According to whosdatedwho.com, Hurley has also dated Niccolo Barattieri di San Pietro, Evgeny Lebedev, David Yarrow, Steve Nash, Steve Bing, Denis Leary, and Theodore Forstmann. Of those relationships, it is pretty obvious that dating Steve Bing had the greatest impact on Hurley’s life as their time together resulted in the birth of her son, Damian Hurley.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We Have A Chance! 15 Actors Who Are Married To Normal People</a></span></p><h2 id=current-status>Current Status</h2><p>According to a June 2020 Us Weekly article, the most recent person that Elizabeth Hurley was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">romantically linked to</a> was Justin Theroux. That said, US Weekly goes out of its way to debunk reports that Hurley and Theroux have ever been a couple as they refer to claims they were a pair were rumors. Furthermore, they include a quote of something hurley said to an Us Weekly reporter denying she dated Theroux while also singing his praises. “We did a job together, and he’s a very nice chap, but they’re definitely not true.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the release of the aforementioned Us Weekly article, several months have passed by. With that in mind, Elizabeth Hurley could have become involved with someone since then, especially since she is still so gorgeous that it seems like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she doesn’t age</a>. That said, there have been no reports of Hurley finding new love, and typically the tabloids breathlessly report it whenever she gets involved with someone. With all of that in mind, it seems like Elizabeth Hurley is single at the time of this writing, at least based on the currently available reporting.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Justin Theroux's Been Up To Since His Divorce From Jennifer Aniston</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWVoba7rcGeq6FlmKq%2FrbHYZqqippehsm7Dx5qrZq%2BVYrivu9ZmmJunpal6qbHRZpuarJmjtG64yJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joshua-bassett-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joshua Bassett Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-2014-album-1989-facts-pop-country-earnings.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Facts About Taylor Swift's 2014 Album, 1989</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
