The first one was nominated for an Oscar, but the second one bombed at the box office. We can all agree on one thing, though: there should be a third movie.</p><p>Sicario, written by Taylor Sheridan, was easily one of the best movies of 2015 and one of the best thrillers of the decade. It told the heart-pounding story of an FBI agent who has to kill the cruel boss of a Mexican drug cartel.</p><p>Soon after, Sicario: Day of the Soldado came out and won a lot of awards. However, it wasn’t a big hit with critics or customers. But forget about all that; Sicario 3 looks like it will be a great return to form. This is what we know.</p><h2 id=sicario-3-release-date>Sicario 3 Release Date</h2><p><strong>The release date for Sicario 3 is set for 2025, as long as the actors’ strike ends soon.</strong></p><p>Because the story is almost done as of November 2023, this is what people think will happen. Producer Trent Trent Luckinbill told Collider, “The strike slowed us down a bit, but we’re pretty close to being able to pull the trigger on that and really start setting up dates.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-4.jpg alt="Sicario 3 Release Date" width=640 height=360 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“We’re really proud of it. Since we worked with Taylor Sheridan, who wrote the last two movies, we always thought this would be at least a three-part project. That means filming should start in 2024, and a 2025 release date seems likely after that. Still, there has been no official word yet, and Sicario 3 might not come out until 2026 if things take a little longer than planned.</p><h2 id=who-will-be-in-sicario-3>Who Will be in Sicario 3?</h2><p><strong>Fans can expect Josh Brolin to play Matt Graver again and Benicio del Toro to play Alejandro Gillick. Emily Blunt will also be back after missing Day of the Soldado.</strong></p><p>Molly Smith and Trent Luckinbill, two producers, told Collider that the story was true. “Our plan is to get the cast back together with Josh, Emily, and Benicio. We have a great story to tell…” We all have a general idea of what the story is about and can’t wait to hopefully get our shooting draft ready soon.</p><p>This is a possible list of the cast for Sicario 3:</p><ul><li>Benicio del Toro as Alejandro Gillick</li><li>Emily Blunt as Kate Mercer</li><li>Josh Brolin as Matt Graver</li><li>Elijah Rodriguez as Miguel Hernandez</li><li>Isabela Moner as Isabel Reyes</li></ul><h2 id=whats-the-story-of-sicario-3>What’s the Story of Sicario 3?</h2><p>We don’t know what will happen in Sicario 3, but based on what happened in the second movie, it looks like the next part of the story will follow Miguel Hernandez’s apprenticeship and Kate Mercer’s comeback.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2-6.jpg alt="Sicario 3 Release Date" width=640 height=360 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At the end of Day of the Soldado, Alejandro Gillick talks to Miguel and makes it seem like he might be willing to help the young gang member So, Sicario 3 will follow their friendship as they move up the cartel’s hierarchy.</p><p>Now that Emily Blunt is back, her character Kate Mercer will be back in the story, though we think she will be hesitant to do so after what happened in the first movie.</p><h2 id=is-there-a-trailer-for-sicario-3>Is there a Trailer for Sicario 3?</h2><p><strong>The script for Sicario 3 has been worked on for years, but there isn’t a clip for it yet because it hasn’t started filming. Because of this, we think the first hint won’t come out until at least 2025.</strong></p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"While waiting for the premiere of the American Ultra 2, you can watch more shows in the same genre.

The film will follow Miguel Hernandez’s apprenticeship and Kate Mercer’s return, with Josh Brolin reprising his role as Matt Graver and Benicio del Toro as Alejandro Gillick.</p><p>Emily Blunt will also return after missing Day of the Soldado. The story is expected to follow their friendship and the return of Kate Mercer. No trailer has been released yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cL%2FInJiroZ9igG6%2BxKWcmquVYrGiwMRmrqGdnmLEqrjLZquhnV2jsrnAjJyfmqikmr9uu8Vmq6GdXZ22tbnAp2StqpmhvKjFjKGgrWWknbKiwMSrqmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./steffy-moreno-net-worth-322119.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Steffy Moreno Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mercades-danielle-net-worth-169889.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mercades Danielle Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
