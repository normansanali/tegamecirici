What is his net worth? His height?</p><h3><strong>David Potts On Kavos Weekender</strong></h3><p>In 2022, David is back in Kavos Weekender. David excitedly announced the news of his return by writing, “I’M BACKKKK!! Goodbye Ibiza, Hello Kavos! Huns are you ready for the new series of Kavos Weekender? New destination. New reps. Same El Jefe 👀 Tuesday 3rd January 2023 we will be gracing your screens.

David said: “<span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>I think it was being back with Tash, for me. Me and Tash are really good friends. We met on the strip, we were walking down the strip, we were vibing! We got to the hotel, we were dancing, we popped open a bottle of Prosecco! We were jumping in the pool. It was fun doing it with Tash again.”</span></p><p>Another Rep joining him this season is Jordan Davies. Jordan announced the news sharing, “WE’RE BACK AT LAST 😎🏖️ New reps, New location, New dramas. Coming to ITV2 January 3rd.”</p><p>An ITV release teasing the new direction said: “The program guarantees the ups and downs, romances and tongue-in-cheek adventures of a holiday in one of the nation’s favorite holiday hotspots.”</p><p>Additional cast members on Kavos Weekender are Tasha Karin, Ethan Aveiro, Lucy Appleton, Jaegia, Joel Frimpong, and Tyler.</p><h3><strong>David Potts Boyfriend</strong></h3><p>Despite his fame, David Potts still managed to enjoy his single life. He was previously dating Luke AKA Luke Vain from Cardiff, someone he met on Celebs Go Dating. However, their relationship ended because “maintaining a relationship with David was always going to be difficult due to the cameras,” according to RealityTitBits.</p><p>Luke told the outlet, “It was very difficult to maintain a relationship when the only time you see each other is in front of the camera. We couldn’t grow organically, because we were never allowed to speak to each other outside of the show.”</p><h3><strong>How Old Is David Potts?</strong></h3><p>According to Famous Birthdays, David Potts’s date of birth is 5 May 1993. Hence as of January 2023, he is 29 years old.</p><h3><strong>David Potts Family</strong></h3><p>David Potts has featured his mom in March 2018 on his IG.</p><p>He wrote, “Happy Mother’s Day to the most amazing woman I know!

I love you so much and you deserve the world ❤️ My mum – The No.1 Mum.”</p><p>The other people David potts might be connected to are <a href=#>Rachael Potts</a> and <a href=#>Matthew Potts</a>.</p><h3><strong>David Potts Height</strong></h3><p>David Potts stands tall at the height of 5’10”. Since Ibiza Weekender last aired, David has been on a bit of a fitness journey. In a side-by-side transformation post on Instagram, David wrote: “Three STONE DOWN HUNS!! Ahhhhh I can’t believe it! I changed my lifestyle four months ago now and I’ve never been so motivated. This new skinny me is only another seven stone away and I cannot wait! I wanna say a massive thank you so @davidnorrispt for pushing me and keeping me motivated!”</p><p>He concluded the post with, “Also wanna say thank you to one of my best friends @hayleyfanshaw for always being there for support! OMG, you huns won’t recognize me 🤪 ps the no filter life is a bit of me.”</p><p>Speaking on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FUBAR Radio</a>, the Celebrity Karaoke Club star told hosts&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bobby Norris and Stephen Leng</a>: “I’m on like this big weight loss journey at the minute. I’ve lost just under two and a half stone.”</p><p>David revealed in great detail how diligently he has been working out: “I’m literally sat in the car park like nearly throwing up for an hour, literally after every [PT] session.”</p><p>David explained to the hosts his new diet<span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>: “It’s called Xante the company I’m working with. It’s just basically a calorie-deficit diet and then I’m also doing my personal training sessions as well with my PT who’s amazing and puts me through my paces. And then I went on holiday to Greece for two weeks and then I put like four pounds back on but I’ve still lost like over two stone.”</span></p><h3><strong>How Much Is David Potts Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>David Potts has a net worth of £500 thousand. He is on Cameo, charging a whopping £95 for a personalized video or £665 for “engaging video content” for businesses. Good value for money, if you ask me.</p><p>David has worked in the travel industry for many years and is not Ibiza Weekender’s top rep by accident. David’s role is to plan the complete island-hopping experience, despite the impression that the reps only do shots and drink cocktails. El Jefe works as a rep in Ibiza, Magaluf, and other tourist hotspots when he isn’t performing on ITV2.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is David Potts Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>David Pott’s birthday is on 5 May.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is David Potts From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>David Potts was born in Manchester,&nbsp;England.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is David Potts On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yes, David Potts is on Instagram (<a href=#>@davidpottsx</a>).</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmnZmmnrFuvM6tq6xlkp68bq7Osp2roZWjsW66xK1ksKeiqbVutMSinqGsXZuurrXLsmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hailey-bieber-self-care-routine-swimsuit-sun-7508640.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hailey Biebers Self-Care Routine Includes a Swimsuit and the Sun</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elmariana-net-worth-307910.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>elmariana Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
