However, they have since apparently called it quits for good. Nadjha then moved on with someone else for a few months until their split. She recently shared details about her messy breakup in a TikTok video.</p><h2 id=h-nadjha-day-says-her-ex-boyfriend-harassed-her-after-their-breakup><strong>Nadjha Day says her ex-boyfriend ‘harassed’ her after their breakup</strong></h2><p id=par-2_47>Around a month after&nbsp;Love Island USA&nbsp;Season 4 wrapped filming, in October 2022, Atlanta-based single Nadjha Day began dating someone new, Jackson. However, they split up. In January 2023, the <a href=#>reality TV</a> star uploaded a “get ready with me” three-minute&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok video</a>&nbsp;in which she dished on her recent breakup.</p><p id=par-3_56>She acknowledged that the couple appeared “perfect” on social media but admitted that wasn’t always the case. According to Nadjha, the relationship started well until he became “one of the worst human beings.” She accused him of being verbally abusive to her throughout their relationship and eventually dumped him after not putting up with it anymore.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-4_63>Additionally, Nadjha called him a “grade A narcissist” and said he used things he gifted her as leverage. When they broke up, she claimed she left everything at their shared condo but retrieved her items when he wasn’t there, including an “expensive watch” he gifted her. Nadjha considered it her “worst mistake” because she claimed he “harassed” her, leading her to block him.</p><p id=par-5_40>The&nbsp;Love Island&nbsp;alum recalled him contacting her through payment service Venmo and email until she responded and told him to leave her alone. According to the Atlanta native, she doesn’t usually “air out dirty laundry” but felt his actions justified it.</p><h2><strong>Nadjha connected with Jeff Christian Jr. for most of ‘Love Island USA’ Season 4</strong></h2><p id=par-6_27>On Day 8, Jeff Christian Jr. entered&nbsp;Love Island USA&nbsp;Season 4 and coupled up with Zeta Morrison when <a href=#>newcomer Bria Bryant</a> paired up with her person, Timmy Pandolfi.</p><p id=par-7_39>However, he moved on to Nadjha when she entered the villa as a “bombshell” on Day 12. Even though they vibed well, they didn’t solidify their relationship, and she moved on with Nicholas “Nic” Birchall when Casa Amor opened.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-8_16>Jeff explored things with newcomer Tigrlily Cooley but decided to fully pursue Nadjha, catching her off-guard.</p><p id=par-9_29>As a result, she ended things with Nic, and the two got closer, eventually physically connected in the Hideaway Suite, and they virtually introduced each other to their families.</p><h2><strong>Nadjha and Jeff attempted a relationship for a couple of weeks after the show</strong></h2><p id=par-10_51>However, she quit a day before the end, resulting in him following her out the door. When the group had to vote out a couple they considered least compatible, they <a href=#>decided on Phoebe Siegel and Chad Robinson,</a> annoying Jeff, who felt the original cast members only looked out for one another.</p><p id=par-11_19>It resulted in a tense exchange with Timmy, and Nadjha attempted to smooth things over by apologizing to him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-12_26>However, it upset Jeff more as he thought she should have had his back, causing Nadjha to exit as she didn’t want to continue with him.</p><p id=par-13_48>Regardless, they reconciled shortly later as they began posting pictures together. She claimed they were working on their relationship, and Jeff later admitted he had “some growing to do.” They eventually decided to call it quits for good as she moved on with her now-ex shortly after that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS5sMLEZqCspJGjsW7B0ppkp5mUn7WiecOasGaaopqurMHPZ5%2BtpZxk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rachel-boston-paul-campbell-navigate-the-dating-scene-as-single-parents-in-hallmarks-dating-the-delaneys.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rachel Boston &amp;amp; Paul Campbell Navigate The Dating Scene as Single Parents in Hallmarks Dating</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lupe-fiasco-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lupe Fiasco Net Worth: Rap Career &amp;amp; Charity</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-arkins-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Alan Arkins Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-bynes-graduation-photo-fidm-2019.html>Amanda Bynes, 33, Shares Rare Photo of Herself As She Proudly Graduates From FIDM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cora-jakes-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346653-html.html>Cora Jakes Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richardson.html>Last name RICHARDSON: origin and meaning</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lea-michele-cancels-life-in-music-tour-broadway-funny-girl.html>Lea Michele Cancels Her Life in Music Tour to Focus on Funny Girl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
