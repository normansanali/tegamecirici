This post is part of my mission to get everyone to eat cabbage more often. This humble vegetable is nutritious, delicious, and versatile (not to mention cheap!), but I’ll admit, from the outside, it can be intimidating.

It calls for 8 basic ingredients, and you can mix up the dough and get it into the oven in under 20 minutes—no rising required! It bakes up with a crisp, golden brown crust and a tender, buttery interior that’s studded with sweet dried currants. Make it for St. Patrick’s Day this weekend…and then, keep making it!

Like, what kind of veggie pizza are we talking here? Because for me, when it comes to pizza, there isn’t one best. Sometimes I’m in the mood for a Neapolitan-style pie with an airy crust and minimal toppings. And sometimes I want something inventive, like the vegan spinach & ranch pizza at Middlebrow in Logan Square. And then there are those nights when nothing but a classic delivery pizza will do. That’s where this veggie pizza…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you’ve never made sheet pan gnocchi before, prepare yourself: once you try it, your weeknight dinner rotation will never be the same! The reason it’s so magical is that you don’t have to boil the gnocchi.&nbsp;That means that this recipe requires no pasta pot and no waiting for water to boil. It comes together on a single sheet pan, and you can get it into the oven, out of the oven, and onto the dinner table in 30 minutes. I got the idea to try it after I developed a skillet gnocchi recipe for my new cookbook.

I’d been using my cast-iron skillet as a DIY tofu press for years, but I often hear from readers about how much they love their tofu presses, and I thought it would be fun to try one out. I decided to experiment with some of the best tofu presses on the market to see how I liked them. …and I’m a tofu press convert!

My plant-based riff on the Japanese noodle soup is warming, comforting, and intensely flavorful. It starts with a rich mushroom broth, which I spike with miso paste for extra umami. Then, I add chewy ramen noodles, savory baked tofu, and loads of fresh toppings–sautéed mushrooms, bok choy, green onions, and daikon radish. A swirl of chili crisp takes it over the top. Ramen is a Japanese preparation of Chinese wheat noodles, and it has been eaten throughout Japan for over a century.

Made with a mix of fresh and dried mushrooms, it tastes unlike any other vegetable broth that you might make or buy at the store. It’s rich, earthy, and umami. Add it to risottos, soups, sauces, and more for delicious depth of flavor! I like to think of this mushroom broth as my winter vegetable broth, because it lends itself so well to the rich, savory dishes that I crave at this time of year.

As much as I love regular broccoli, I have to say…I’m team broccolini! In fact, it’s one of my favorite vegetables to cook with. I think it’s so pretty, with its bright green florets and long, slender stems. It’s also easy to prepare and incredibly versatile. You can serve it as a side dish or add it to frittatas, pastas, salads, and more. It’s available in many grocery stores year round, so if you’re not already cooking with it, now’s the time to start!

Its name literally translates to “pasta and beans,” and it consists of tiny pasta, creamy beans, and tender vegetables in a fragrant tomato broth. Here in the US, many people know pasta e fagioli from the menu at Olive Garden, but I’m here to tell you that you HAVE to try making this dish at home. It comes together in one pot. The ingredients are largely pantry staples.

They’re intensely flavorful, made with roasted mushrooms, a mix of savory spices, and balsamic vinegar for tang.
