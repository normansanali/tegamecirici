reported.&nbsp; The Steelers selected Conner with the 105th overall pick in the 2017 draft.&nbsp;Spotrac&nbsp;estimated his rookie deal will be worth a total of&nbsp;$3,177,188, and he’ll carry an estimated cap hit of&nbsp;$641,571 in his first season.</p><p>The Steelers shared a photo of Conner signing the contract: “We’re very excited about this young man,” Steelers running backs coach James Saxon said in a statement on the&nbsp;team’s official site. “Excellent football player, hard worker. He is a no-frills football player running the ball downhill. He is a great guy. What he does as a football player is what we want.”</p><p>Conner ran for 1,092 yards and 16 touchdowns in his final season with the Pittsburgh&nbsp;Panthers. He added 21 catches for 302 yards and four touchdowns, too. The 22-year-old had to put his football career on hold in December 2015 after he&nbsp;announced&nbsp;he had been diagnosed with&nbsp;Hodgkin lymphoma. But last May, doctors&nbsp;declared&nbsp;him cancer-free.</p><p><span class=s1>Conner couldn’t have asked for a better situation to start his&nbsp;NFL career. Not only does the Erie, Pennsylvania, native get to play close to home, but he also joined the team for which the running game is a staple of its offense. He</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;won’t replace incumbent starting running back Le’Veon Bell any time soon, but he could occupy a role similar to DeAngelo Williams, who had 98 carries for 343 yards and four touchdowns while backing Bell up in 2016.</span></p><p><span class=s1>Bell is also playing the 2017 season under the franchise tag. If the Steelers are high enough on Conner’s potential, they could make him the starting running back in 2018 should they reach a contract stalemate with Bell.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=james-conner-twitter></span>James Conner Twitter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by JamesConner_</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=james-conner-instagram></span>James Conner Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKRorK0ecKopaedomKurrHRopqapl2bvLDAwZqjpWWSnryovsCpn7JlkqSxunnMnpisraKauqa606xknKecobKosYycmKudlad6sb7On5ysq5mku6K4jJyYq52Vp3qku82tqZqbpGJ%2FcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./josiah-cross.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Josiah Cross Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth &amp;amp; Parents</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-mike-from-american-pickers-married.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Mike from American Pickers married?
