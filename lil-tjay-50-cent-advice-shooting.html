This right here, you shake this shit off,” Tjay recalled 50 telling him over the phone from a jet. “You got the length for greatness. You going to be bigger than ever.”</p><p></p><p>The Power mogul remained a big brother figure for Lil Tjay in the months after the shooting, with <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>the two being pictured hanging out backstage</a> at a Motion Picture & Television Fund benefit concert — where 50 Cent performed alongside <a href=# rel=noopener>Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Tony Yayo</a> and others — in Los Angeles in September.</p><p>Tjay later <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>dropped a remix of 50’s Get Rich or Die Tryin’ track “Many Men” called “FACESHOT,”</a> on which he channeled the G-Unit general’s bulletproof defiance by addressing the culprit who almost killed him.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I know many men out there wanna get me, tell ’em bend again/ Never on no scary shit, not afraid like Eminem/ Singin’ n-gga, but you sleep on me that be your flaw/ Lettin’ me live that was stupid, must think one plus two is four,” he rapped.</p><p>Elsewhere in his Rolling Stone interview, Lil Tjay spoke about coming down with a near-lethal fever in hospital, recording his comeback single <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>“Beat the Odds”</a> while doctors were still draining blood out of his lungs, and how the experience has profoundly changed his outlook on life.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/01/lil-tjay-shows-off-gunshot-scars-while-returning-to-new-jersey-250x142.jpg alt="Lil Tjay Shows Off Gunshot Scars While Returning To New Jersey" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Lil Tjay Shows Off Gunshot Scars While Returning To New Jersey</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>January 3, 2023</p></a><p>“I got airlifted into the sky at 2:22, and it was June 22, 2022,” he said. “When I searched those numbers, it was like ‘God’s giving you the opportunity to change.’ I questioned God before that. I don’t anymore. I know God’s real, a billion percent.”</p><p>He added: “I’m not on no tough-guy shit, or on some angel shit. I feel like a miracle kid. I feel like my purpose is bigger than I know.
