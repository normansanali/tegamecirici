That bodes badly for the living, but works wonders to preserve the dead.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Siberian Times</a>, that’s where Dr. Elena Solovyova found a female mummy this summer. Buried in a sand grave below the permafrost, the elements had preserved her so well that her foal-skin stockings and the Christian cross on her chest remained intact.</p><p>“Her soft tissues have preserved very well,” said Solovyova. “This was natural mummification. Maybe she was buried in winter and frozen.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Sun</a>, it was initially believed that this was the site of Lensky Ostrog — Russia’s first settlement in the region, founded in 1632. Previous radiocarbon dating on graves in the area supported the notion that burials occurred there between 1440 and 1670.</p><p>This latest find, however, has dashed all hopes that this was the case.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-247254 alt="Copper Cross From Mummy" width=720 height=501 data-sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/copper-cross-from-yakutia-mummy.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-247254 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Elena Solovyova/The Siberian Times</span><span class=caption-body>Researchers analyzed the mummified woman’s copper cross, which didn’t appear to be traditional.</span></p><p>Not only have there been concerns that these dates weren’t reliable, but the woman’s copper cross, clothing, and radiocarbon dating clearly indicate she was an ethnic Yakut — not Russian — and buried much later.</p><p>This has forced regional experts to reassess what they know.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Daily Mail</a>, while the woman was clearly a Christian, she was almost definitely an ethnic Yakut and buried in the mid-1800s. If the site had, indeed, been Lensky Ostrog, the conquest of Siberia would’ve dated back to the 1630s.</p><p>“After we cleaned this cross, we noticed that it didn’t quite look traditional,” Solovyova explained. “We analyzed the inscriptions and came to the conclusion that they were made by a local Yakutian master because there were some ‘mistakes’ in the lettering.”</p><p>Not only do researchers now believe the site dates to the 19th century, but that some of the woman’s clothing was machine-made. Her leather stockings even had torbasa attached — traditional Yakutian boots lined with fur.</p><p>“The lower part of her clothes are preserved,” said Solovyova. “These were underwear made of fur, traditional Yakutian clothing, plus stockings up to the hips, made of the skin of a foal with fur inside.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-247258 alt="Archaeologist Digs Up Bones In Siberia" width=720 height=405 data-sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/archaeologist-digs-up-bones-in-siberia.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-247258 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Andrey Khoroshev</span><span class=caption-body>Other remains dug up in 2014 were unreliably dated to match the founding of Lensky Ostrog.</span></p><p>While archaeologists like Solovyova are no strangers to digging up bodies and encountering unsightly antiquities, she felt uncomfortable with an exhaustive analysis on the buried woman’s remains.</p><p>“We did not do the full morphological research [on] this woman, even though there was a plan to take the skulls of people buried on this cemetery to understand if they were Russians or Yakuts,” she said. “I could not do this for ethical reasons.”</p><p>“The woman was mummified, not just scattered bones. I just could not make myself separate her head from [her] body. But I’m sure that this woman was Yakut.”</p><p>While Solovyova doesn’t reject the possibility that this graveyard could have been built on top of a much older one — and that Lensky Ostrog could very well sit below — there simply hasn’t been any proof of that yet.</p><p>While Siberia continues to reveal more ancient specimens like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">horses</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lions</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wolves</a>, it seems like Russia’s first settlement in the region has yet to be discovered.</p><p>After learning about the mummified woman from the 1800s found in Siberia, take a look at <a href=#>the 5,600-year-old mummy</a> that revealed the oldest Egyptian embalming recipe ever found.
